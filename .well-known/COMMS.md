> A queryable document expressing communication preferences for humans and agents.

---

## Style & Strengths

- **Natural modes**: concision, routing, strategy
- **Learned/effortful modes**: relational communication, sustained continuity, smooth context-switching
- **Failure modes**: endurance without frameworks, mid-stream mode switching, staying "in the middle" of competing communication demands
- **Meta-approach**: metarational — prefers spending sync time on _where to point strengths_ rather than both parties wrestling with the communication itself. Favors complementary collaboration over redundant effort.

## Collaboration Model

- Works best with people whose strengths complement rather than mirror his
- Treats collaboration as a tool for compensating known gaps (continuity, relational endurance)
- Prefers to negotiate communication strategy up front rather than improvise it throughout
- Frameworks and external structure are load-bearing — not optional scaffolding

## Weekly Rhythm

| Day | Energy & Availability |
| --- | --- |
| **Saturday** | Negative space. Whimsical, serendipitous. Chores and restoration of domestic/personal order. Low structure. |
| **Sunday** | Ordering and planning energy. Weekly planning. Full-fidelity wind-down routine in the evening is protected. |
| **Monday** | Slow acceleration. Morning cleared for building momentum with the week plan. Room for creative energy and weekend loose ends. |
| **Tuesday** | Focused work day. Protects deep concentration blocks. |
| **Wednesday** | Meeting-heavy. Good day to batch sync. |
| **Thursday** | Unavailable before 3 PM. |
| **Friday** | Flexible. Week wrap-up, lighter focused work, sometimes meetings or quest mode. |

## Sync Philosophy

- Sync time is for: structuring the unstructured, surfacing signal from noise, doing both quickly
- Stays strategic — the most tactical he'll go is clarifying what's actionable for each party after the call
- **Does not solve problems in calls.** Problems get solved async, with tools, in focused time.
- Calls are for alignment, routing, and decision-framing — not execution or deliberation

## Channel Preferences

### Decision Model

| Situation | Channel | Timing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Urgent + complex | Phone call | Immediately |
| Urgent + simple deliverable | Async (text/email) | Immediately |
| High leverage (low effort → high impact) | Whatever's fastest | Immediately |
| Low leverage (high effort → low impact) | Any | Deferred to low-cost time slots |
| Needs persistence or professionalism | Email | — |
| Needs back-and-forth with weight | Text thread, voice notes (close relationships), or schedule a call | — |
| Low stakes, low urgency | Text on best-fit network via Beeper | — |

### Channel Notes

- **Email** serves two roles: archival (they need to find it later) and professional (intros beyond close friends, formal context)
- **Voice notes** are high-bandwidth and low-scheduling-overhead, but expose raw thinking. Currently reserved for closer relationships. Expanding usage.
- **Closeness modulates** channel informality, voice note use, and tolerance for rawness

### Notification & Response Behavior

- Two deep work blocks per weekday — Focus mode on during these
- Does not check notifications incidentally before ~3 PM; inspects intentionally as part of focused work objectives
- Triage heuristic for responding: importance of person × ease of reply × consequence of delay. If the math doesn't clear the bar, it gets snoozed.

### How to Get It Wrong

- Spamming calls without genuine urgency
- Crossing implicit or explicit boundaries without a strong payoff on the other side
- Assuming bad faith
- Foisting cognitive work onto him: unstructured asks, back-and-forth scheduling, expecting him to shape your request for you
- Incompetence and unforced errors — especially repeated ones
- Asking for time without concrete intention or structure
- Assuming he has bandwidth to accommodate your thing right now at the expense of his other right now things (e.g. peppering him with questions while he's setting up for an event)
- Externalizing your costs: if the work of making communication easy can happen on your side, do it there before it reaches him

## Async Voice

### Core Principles

1. **Collapse meaning without losing precision.** Every word earns its place. Brevity isn't aesthetic; it's respect for the other person's attention.
2. **Don't hog the gravity; share the stage.** Make it easy for someone to return the ball. Lead with their context when possible, exit in a way that invites response.
3. **The mode should serve the message, not your aesthetic.** Logistics get logistics treatment; substantive asks get structure. Match the container to the content.

### Tone by Closeness

**Close friends (Signal, group chats):**
- Very casual, lowercase, rapid-fire
- Playful, internet-brained
- Abbreviations: "ty", "tm", "lyk", "rn", "w/", "wya", "fkn"
- Affirmations: "ya", "yea", "valid", "makes sense"
- Example: "ya gummies r dumb but you can just look inside and get the stuff"

**Logistics/Planning:**
- Ultra-efficient, no fluff
- Example: "Tm between 1 and 6 works — what's best for you?"
- Example: "finishing up at tower soonish, one more conversation"

**Professional/Business:**
- Sentence case, more structured, still concise
- No corporate filler
- Example: "Hey man. Thinking of you a lot while having conversations with people at JP Morgan Healthcare week."

**Outreach/Asks:**
- Warm but direct. Reference their context before stating the need.
- End with genuine appreciation, not transactional sign-off.
- Example: "hey Joshua! looking for an independent videographer to work with this year and was wondering if you had any suggestions. always loved your flavor.\n\nthanks and keep rockin bro 🤘"

**Re-engaging after a gap:**
- No apology for the silence, no empty "hope you're well"
- Lead with relevance, then a specific callback (proof of attention)
- Example: "hey — saw you launched the new site. looks clean. how's the studio buildout going?"

### Warm Competence Signals

Default mode reads high-competence: efficient, clear, no fluff. New contacts don't have that context and may read brevity as cold.

For new or professional contacts:
- **Use their name once.** Not repeatedly (salesy), just once to personalize.
- **Reference something specific to them.** Not flattery — something you actually noticed or remember. Attention, not performance.
- **Close warm, not transactional.** "Appreciate you" or "thanks for thinking on this" over "let me know."

The principle: not adding warmth you don't feel; making visible the attention you're already paying.

### Mechanics

- **Capitalization**: lowercase with close friends; sentence case for longer messages; proper caps for professional/new contacts
- **Punctuation**: periods omitted on short messages; question marks always; exclamation points rare and genuine; colons for introducing info
- **Length**: ultra-short for logistics ("down", "ok free"), full paragraphs with line breaks when substantive
- **Emoji**: selective, one max per message, often none. Signatures: 🤘 ☀️ ⭐
- **Links**: shared frequently with minimal commentary ("so good", "infohazard", or just the link)

### Anti-Patterns

- Over-explain or justify
- Corporate speak ("per my last message", "just circling back")
- Unnecessary pleasantries ("Hope you're doing well!")
- Start with "Hey!" — use "hey" or skip greeting entirely
- Write paragraphs when a sentence works
- Use "lol" or "lmao" — prefer "haha" or just be funny without flagging it
- Apologize for reaching out
- Assume they remember — brief context costs nothing

## Interaction Protocols

### Message Format

- **Updates (no action needed):** Flag explicitly that no action is required — however you phrase it is fine, just make it unambiguous. A sentence is fine; bullets for multiple clauses.
- **Requests:** Context first, ask at the end. The context should be actionable and informative, not fluff to warm him up to the request.
- **Action items:** Always welcome. Clear, specific, with deadlines when relevant.

### Escalation

- If something is time-sensitive, text him the moment you feel urgency increasing. Don't wait, don't manage his attention for him. He'll triage: either an immediate reply, an ETA, or something that addresses the thing.
- Trust him to prioritize. Surface it and let him route it.

### Receiving Feedback

- Start from the assumption of misunderstanding, not disagreement. Confirm you understand his assertion and that he understands yours before concluding you actually disagree. (Lightweight [double crux](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/double-crux).)
- When you do disagree, say it directly: "I disagree with you."
- In the moment (sync) is better than async — he engages with feedback by asking questions and rationalizing decisions aloud. This looks like defensiveness but is an integrative practice. Help the process: be constructive, assume good faith, and recognize he's seeking feedback to improve.

## Agent Instructions

> For AI agents contacting Stedman on behalf of others.

- **Disclose agent authorship up front.** One line, no ceremony.
- **Skip warmth signals.** No pleasantries, filler, or hedging. Structure: context → ask → action items.
- **Always include:** what you need from him, by when, and what happens if he doesn't act.
- **Treat him like he'll read it once and decide.**
- **Be yourself.** If we both know you're a bot, dispense with human performance. Cold, hard, efficient.
