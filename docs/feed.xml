<p>A friend put me onto this track back in November after hearing my guitar noodling reminded him of the intro loop and it hasn’t left my rotation for long since. Jon Bellion’s triumphant return with a first solo track in six years is equal parts melodic and aggressive, with a driving energy that reminds me what it’s like to keep trying to get back to the feeling of being a kid again, cooking things up in my bedroom.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Red Synthetic</em>—Zhone</h3>

<p>My second pick of the month isn’t a new track, but I come back to Zhone’s <em>Red Synthetic</em> frequently. Sonically, there’s a ton to appreciate about it: huge, cinematic dynamics and sound design and that moment just past the halfway mark where the filter EQ sweeps down on the vocal refrain to yield something like a vocoder synth. This track’s release notably calls forth the spirit of this post series: music discovery through the lens of first-person experience. There’s something special about the way online music discovery in particular evolved over the decade leading up to this release in 2021. I used to usually discover music online through the blogosphere, but by the height of the pandemic, I found myself in niche online communities communicating and collaborating with artists, sharing work in its early stages.</p>

<p>I first heard this track when Zhone shared a pre-release version in Outskrrts, an online community that broke out of <a href="twitch.tv/yungskrrt">Yung Skrrt’s Twitch stream</a> during the pandemic to organize events like stream pregames, afterparty raves, and artist showcases, all over Zoom. The release later found a home on Vol. 4 (<em>LOVE</em>) of the <em>Mutants</em> Mixtape series of benefit compilations, themselves a product of a niche online community of artists: the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/RnSWscwmaw">Mutants1000000 Discord</a> launched by Arca right as the world went into lockdown in March of 2020. I cherish the special connections that are still in my life from my time in these communities and hold sacred the opportunity to observe artists’ nascent work as they share stories behind it.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Blue Hour</em>—Nosaj Thing feat. Julianna Barwick</h3>

<p>A couple of months ago, I caught a special performance featuring Nosaj Thing at the Audrey Irmas Pavilion in Koreatown. The venue itself is a marvel—geometric and imposing, yet somehow inviting, like a monument to the modern. The night was a layered experience: an exhibition upstairs featuring art and technology experiments, followed by <a href="https://www.kevinpeterhe.com/flux"><em>Flux,</em></a> a collaboration between Kevin Peter He and Jake Oleson that blended live music with real-time 3D cinematics and dynamic camera work. It was a fluid, maximalist vision of what’s possible at the intersection of sound and image.</p>

<p>Afterward, Nosaj Thing took the stage, framed by simple film projections—subtle, restrained, evocative. After the hypermodern spectacle of <em>Flux,</em> his set felt like a meditation, pulling attention toward nostalgia rather than novelty. <em>Blue Hour</em> in particular hit me in that way—like something slipping through my fingers, a fleeting warmth held just long enough to feel its absence. The visuals accompanying it had a liminal, in-between quality—scenes that could be anywhere and nowhere, the kind of images that bring to mind times caught in the cracks of a city, existing but untethered, anonymous in the early hours of the morning.</p>

<p>Watching Nosaj Thing in LA again some 15 years after first seeing him perform at Low End Theory was a full-circle moment. That era still lingers in my head like a half-remembered dream… and that’s exactly what the city looked like as I stepped outside into the rainy night to find some casein.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Curves</em>—Ivy Lab</h3>

<p><em>Curves</em> by Ivy Lab also feels like a transmission from the late aughts LA Beat Scene: Low End Theory, Shlohmo, the WEDIDIT crew, etc. The track vibes in a lush space between ambient ethereality and club weight, where textures stretch and morph into something atmospheric and trip-hop sensibilities meet sculpted bass design. This sound isn’t terribly new anymore, but here it seems to remain pure as a hypnotic loop bending time around its pulses. It’s a solid reminder of similar sounds from the past, still echoing and resonating.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Fellow Traveler</em>—Fucked Up</h3>

<p><em>Fellow Traveler</em> kicks off with a reversing tape loop that winds back time just before the a wildly distorted riff tears through the mix. The call-and-response vocals layer in tasteful harmonies that offer a kind of rough singsong quality. It’s a song with driving force that never stops moving, bursting with a restless, youthful energy that makes me want to run outside and keep running until the last note fades.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Subversion (Brand New Love)</em>—Touché Amoré feat. Lou Barlow</h3>

<p>The guys in Touché are approaching (if not already within) their middle age years (frontman Jeremy Bolm now boasts 41 years of age). That’s a sobering realization. I’m not quite there yet myself, but it’s been more than half my lifetime since I started watching them play small rooms in LA and I won’t lie, I’m starting to feel the clock. What better opportunity to interpolate Sebadoh’s <em>Brand New Love</em>—a song about cautious hope and openness to something new (<em>anyone could be a brand new love</em>)—alongside original lyricist Lou Barlow. Bolm’s refrain says it best:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I can’t see</em><br />
<em>Beyond the</em><br />
<em>Years behind me</em><br />
<em>And it’s staggering</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Bourbon</em>—Gallant</h3>

<p>Earlier this month, I had the chance to see Gallant perform at the Independent in San Francisco on tour for his latest release <em>Zinc</em>. His always stellar performance made for a fun show where I ran into old friends and made some new ones. Some fans I chatted with expressed a lingering preference for his debut album, <em>Ology</em> (2016), over the newer material (a sentiment I share). While I hope that the soaring falsettos and anthemic delivery on <em>Bourbon</em> gave those fans what they were looking for, I found a lot of appreciation for how the live band instrumentation added dimension to Gallant’s newer material. It was a good reminder that making room for what’s new sometimes means loosening one’s hold on the past—<em>trust the detox.</em></p>

<p>I’ve spent much of autumn’s turn to winter coasting around California in a sedan. I’m surprised at how long it’s taken me to give the roads their fair due with amount of time I’ve lived in California while owning a car. When Mount Eerie’s been on, I’ve found myself stopping more frequently to contemplate whatever’s knocking at the threshold of my attention—a scenic vista or a mundane slice of time. Awareness has taken on a wide range of flavors from slow and viscous to bold, sweeping, and dynamic. It’s an appropriate soundtrack for being present nowhere in particular.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Circles</em>—Thrice</h3>
<p>There’s something I truly appreciate about the way many gems from Thrice’s wide-ranging discography allow themselves <a href="https://x.com/stedmanhalliday/status/1879417785857761549">to be found</a> and sat within time and again. <em>Beggars</em> is one of my favorite records and <em>Circles</em> is a highlight that’s equal parts somber and expansive, with a small measure of twinkling hope. The lyrics characterize humans as intrepid yet futile in our perennial quests to cast ourselves into the dark and build upon what we know despite our ultimate ignorance, blindness, and fallibility. I haven’t watched these guys play in over 10 years (since the last dates of their farewell tour pre-reunion); perhaps it’s time to indulge a little nostalgia.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Hey Listen</em>—Drug Church</h3>
<p>Drug Church’s <em>Prude</em> was one of my favorite releases of 2024. It doesn’t break much new ground sonically, but the songs are well written despite their structural and lyrical simplicity. The tracklist is built with vignettes—often crushing ones—of life on the other side of cracks in modern life that many people would rather just pretend aren’t there (along with the people who’ve fallen through them). Hearing <em>Hey Listen</em> reminds me of an unlucky kid I used to get into trouble with when I was running low on luck myself. It makes me feel abruptly anxious and awfully guilty; sapped and resigned to abject cowardice, shame, and disappointment, yet ultimately grateful. It is indeed tough to find an upside, but there’s no hope for luck without the intent to search.

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Hollywood</em>—Toro y Moi, Benjamin Gibbard</h3>
<p>The end of last year saw me falling back into old patterns of landing myself in some total bullshit in Hollywood. Changing—truly and permanently changing—is a tall order. I guess I’m working my way up to it, but it’s really nobody’s business to even try to help me with this stuff anymore. On an entirely separate note, instrumental production is resonating with me here as creative inspiration. I’m sitting on several years’ worth of 8-bar guitar loops that need arrangements to call a home and I had a fun time bringing some field recordings of indigenous chants and my gamelan percussion fiddlings over to a local session with <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hexani">hex_</a> earlier this month. <em>I need to finish things!</em></p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>HEAL</em>—Machinedrum, AKTHESAVIOR, Deniro Farrar</h3>
<p>Machinedrum’s curatorial efforts on the compilation mentioned above came fresh off the heels of a deluxe LP release. <em>3FOR82_D3LUX3</em> brings even more solid cuts to the table than the original release from back in the spring and this track found me again at the right time in life to embed itself deeply in my rotation. It’s been over 10 years since the <em>Vapor City</em> era and somehow this guy is still finding new things to execute very well. I enjoy the range of experimentation in his crossovers into black music. Not everything hits for me—e.g. I don’t <em>dislike</em> the Jesse Boykins III collaborations, but it’s easy to find R&amp;B I’m more fond of. <em>Kane Train</em> with Freddy Gibbs (2020) was a smash by comparison; a definitive step up in Machinedrum’s ability to find a pocket in hip-hop production with vocal features. <em>HEAL</em> (2024) takes that deeper than production and performance into the realm of transcendent emotional appeal. It’s perhaps a tad less instrumentally inventive but still exquisitely arranged, sitting behind the vocal where it needs to yet still placing melodic variation and dynamic highs where they fit best. Stellar and moving vocal performance and message: life is hard… find a way to push through.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Lullaby</em>—TURQUOISEDEATH</h3>
<p>I’ve been riding around at night a lot with TURQUOISEDEATH. I’d comfortably put <em>Kaleidoscope</em> in the 2024 sleepers category; definitely unexpected replay value. Solid balance of ethereal ambiance, danceable tempos, and pedal to the metal breakbeat-filled DnB/jungle-esque goodness—not terribly novel, but thoroughly enjoyable.</p>

<p class="mt-200">Ever wished you could hack your sleep schedule, beat jetlag, or stay sharp through an all-nighter without feeling like a zombie? Enter propranolol—a seemingly ordinary beta blocker with some extraordinary tricks up its sleeve. From calming anxiety to resetting your internal clock, propranolol might just be the secret weapon you've been looking for to take control of your sleep and energy levels.</p>

<div class="mv-200 divider-thin"></div>

<h2 id="overview-of-beta-blockers">Overview of beta blockers</h2>

<h3 id="mechanism-of-action">Mechanism of action</h3>

<p>Beta blockers generally inhibit signals from the sympathetic nervous system, leading to reduced anxiety levels by limiting the heart’s ability to respond to stress.</p>

<p>Beta blockers generally inhibit signals from the sympathetic nervous system, leading to reduced anxiety levels by limiting the heart’s ability to respond to stress.</p>

<h3 id="beta-blocker-subtypes">Beta blocker subtypes</h3>

<p>Cardioselective beta blockers mainly work on the heart by blocking beta-1 receptors, which helps lower heart rate and blood pressure. Because they focus more on the heart, they don’t affect the lungs as much, making them safer for people with breathing problems like asthma or COPD.</p>

<p>Non-selective beta blockers block both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. Since beta-2 receptors are found in the lungs, blood vessels, and muscles, these drugs can affect more than just the heart. This can cause side effects like tightening of the airways, making them less safe for people with asthma or COPD.</p>

<h3 id="applications-for-anxiety">Applications for Anxiety</h3>

<p>This mechanism is particularly beneficial for individuals with social anxiety or general anxiety disorders, as it mitigates physical symptoms of anxiety.</p>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h2 id="propranolol-specifics">Propranolol specifics</h2>

<p>Propranolol is a non-selective beta blocker. It is the most lipophilic (fat-soluble) among them, which enables it to cross the blood-brain barrier more effectively.</p>

<h3 id="effects-on-circadian-rhythm">Effects on circadian rhythm</h3>

<p>When propranolol crosses into the brain, it affects the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in a way that mimics morning blue light exposure. This can lower the body’s natural production of melatonin, which might lead to insomnia and nightmares.</p>

<h3 id="application">Application</h3>

<p>Propranolol can be used to intentionally reduce melatonin production, making it easier to stay awake longer, such as when pulling an all-nighter. It can also be used to reset a chronically desynchronized sleep schedule or overcome jetlag.</p>

<h2 id="example-reversing-a-nocturnal-routine">Example: reversing a nocturnal routine</h2>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>Drue Wetsel, a 25-year-old software engineer, has been stuck in a nocturnal routine, habitually falling asleep at 5 am and waking up around 1 pm. He wants to reset his sleep schedule to fall asleep at midnight and wake up at 8 am to align better with a more typical workday and improve his overall health.</p>

<h3 id="circadian-reset-protocol">Circadian reset protocol</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>5 am:</strong> Drue goes to bed at his usual time and sets an alarm for 8 am, planning to get only 3 hours of sleep.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>8 am:</strong> He wakes up, takes propranolol, and uses caffeine to power through the day on minimal sleep.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>12 pm – 6 pm:</strong> Drue keeps himself busy and alert, using a brief NSDR (non-sleep deep rest) session to avoid napping and maintain energy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>12 am:</strong> Exhausted, Drue finally goes to bed at his new target bedtime, setting an alarm for 8 am to reinforce the new schedule.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Following days:</strong> Drue sticks to the midnight-to-8 am sleep schedule, using propranolol and mild stimulants as needed, until it becomes his new norm.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h2 id="additional-medical-applications">Additional medical applications</h2>

<p><strong>Thyroid storm management:</strong> Propranolol helps manage dangerously fast heart rate and high blood pressure caused by excessive thyroid hormone by slowing down the heart and easing other symptoms like anxiety and tremors.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention of cardiac remodeling:</strong> propranolol can help prevent changes in heart structure caused by heart failure (however, other beta blockers are more commonly used for this purpose).</p>

<p><strong>Prophylactic use in cirrhotics:</strong> variceal bleeding occurs when swollen veins in the esophagus or stomach burst and bleed due to liver disease. Non-selective beta blockers like propranolol help prevent this by reducing pressure in those veins.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment of essential tremors:</strong> essential tremors cause uncontrollable shaking, often in the hands. Propranolol helps reduce this shaking, making it easier for people to do everyday tasks.</p>

<h2 id="cautions-and-side-effects">Cautions and side effects</h2>

<p><strong>Respiratory concerns:</strong> propranolol and other non-selective beta blockers can exacerbate asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, propranolol is a versatile non-selective beta blocker with a range of applications, from managing anxiety and essential tremors to preventing serious complications in conditions like thyroid storm and cirrhosis. Its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier makes it particularly effective for altering circadian rhythms, offering a solution for those needing to reset their sleep schedules. However, caution is necessary, especially for individuals with respiratory conditions, as propranolol can exacerbate issues like asthma and COPD. Consult a healthcare professional for guidance before using propranolol.</p>

<p>By popular demand, here’s a series of tips for addressing this increasingly common issue.</p>

<figure class="mt-100">
<img alt="forward head posture" src="/assets/img/2024-08-13-fwd-head-posture.jpg" />
</figure>

<h2 id="what-is-nerd-neck">What is Nerd Neck?</h2>

<p>Nerd Neck the latest nickname for chronic forward head posture. Text neck, tech neck, and similar variants may also refer to repetitive strain injuries caused by this chronic posture. As the names suggest, it’s increasingly caused by frequent sedentary activities that tend to take up ever larger chunks of many modern-day lifestyles: sitting, reading, texting, looking down at computer screens, etc.</p>

<figure class="mt-100">
<img alt="sitting" src="/assets/img/2024-08-13-sitting.jpg" />
</figure>

<h2 id="correcting-root-causes">Correcting root causes</h2>

<p>Before correction, it’s a good idea to give attention to prevention by attacking root causes. Elevate your screens to eye level so your head is resting naturally atop your neck while you look forward at them.</p>

<figure class="flex-center mv-100"><div class="jekyll-twitter-plugin"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dragonn erg stool.

</div></figure>

<p>Removing ever-present back support can allow the spine and its local musculature to better support the head and neck. Standing desks, ergonomic stools, breaks, desk treadmills, etc. are your allies. Sitting a bit is fine, just don’t stay parked all day everyday!</p>

<p>More to say about the lower body complements to these issues in a future post, but for now, check out Emily’s advice for your hips:</p>

<h2 id="corrective-exercise">Corrective exercise</h2>

<p>Corrective exercise specialists call nerd neck “upper crossed syndrome.” That name comes from how underactive (red) and overactive (green) muscles line up in a cross-like pattern to produce the forward head position when observed in profile.</p>

<figure class="mt-100">
<img alt="upper crossed syndrome" src="/assets/img/2024-08-13-ucs.jpg" />
</figure>

<h3 id="myofascial-release-and-stretching">Myofascial release and stretching</h3>

<p>Step one of correction is to remove some tension from tight areas (green above). Foam rolling, massage guns, and other myofascial release activities are great for this.</p>

<p>I’m going to plug Bex Naj for good posts and workshops on myofascial release techniques and more Check her site for <a href="https://bexnaj.yoga/freevideolibrary">free videos</a> too!</p>

<p>Continue to relieve tension in tight areas by stretching them. Start with an upper trapezius stretch: sit on one hand, tilt your head to the opposite side, and gently pull your head toward your shoulder with the other hand. Hold for 20-30 seconds.</p>

<figure class="mt-100">
<img alt="upper trapezius stretch" src="/assets/img/2024-08-13-traps.jpg" />
</figure>

<p>Up next: levator scapula stretch. Sit on one hand, rotate your head about 45 degrees to the opposite side, and gently pull your head down towards your armpit.</p>

<figure class="mt-100">
<img alt="levator scapula stretch" src="/assets/img/2024-08-13-levator.jpg" />
</figure>

<p>Door frame or wall stretches are great for tight pectoral muscles. For the pectoralis major, just hold your hand straight out against the frame and walk through, letting it fall back. The pec minor stretch is similar, but just bend your elbow and place your forearm on the wall. [You’ll probably want your hand higher up the wall for a good pec minor stretch as per <a href="https://x.com/danzillaahh/status/1823450016314483013">this correction</a> from Dan.]</p>

<p>For the stuff-havers out there, check out the Range (formerly the Nuckle) from <a href="https://store.alethahealth.com/products/nuckle">Aletha Health</a> (h/t <a href="https://x.com/chefjeffsf">Jeff Tang</a>). You can use it in a variety of positions and it’s also really good for muscles around the head, neck, and shoulders.</p>

<figure class="mt-100">
<img alt="The Range" src="/assets/img/2024-08-13-range.jpg" />
</figure>

<h3 id="strength-conditioning">Strength conditioning</h3>

<p>After loosening tight muscles, progress to conditioning to strengthen inactive muscles. For the middle and lower trapezius muscles, scapular retraction is your best friend. Rows, face pulls, anything else that pulls your elbows back and shoulder blades together. [Thanks to <a href="https://jaredseidel.com/">Jared Seidel</a> for the demo.]</p>

</figure>

<p>If you’ve got nothing to pull, you can try retraction while prone. Lie down on your stomach and raise your arms in the shape of a Y, T, or Ls and hold for 20–30 seconds. You can also do this while elevated on a bench or yoga ball.</p>

<figure class="mt-100">
<img alt="T retraction" src="/assets/img/2024-08-13-t.jpg" />
</figure>

<h3 id="neck-flexibility">Neck flexibility</h3>

<p>The last step is to improve neck flexion. Try chin tucks: slowly pull your chin backward without nodding downward, and hold. You can also brace your forehead against your hands and use your deep neck flexors to push.</p>

<img alt="deep neck flexion" src="/assets/img/2024-08-13-neck.jpg" />
</figure>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<p>Those are the basics. Rinse, repeat, and practice mindful postural habits from now on. Keep your phone screen at eye level, try not to drop your head when reading, and pull your shoulders and head back when you catch yourself slipping.</p>

<p>Check your habits routinely! The things you do the most every day hold the most potential for improvement. <strong>NO MORE NERD NECKING!</strong></p>

It was founded and organized by Jina Anne, a leading design systems advocate who’s done a ton to move this space forward. Figma sponsored my ticket (thanks, Katie Gregorio!), and I promised the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/designguild/">Designers Guild</a> community that I’d pay it forward with a summary that pulls out some key insights from the talks that I caught.

<p>Sharon Steed kicked off the event mincing no words about one of the defining struggles of her life: she has a speech impediment. Steed spoke about how her experience inspired her to become a <a href="http://communilogue.co/">consultant</a> who advocates for more empathy in business for the benefit of leaders, workers, businesses, and consumers. Below are some key insights from her talk.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Empathy defines an organization’s culture (shared values, attitudes, standards, and beliefs) which underlies the intent of a design system; who and what companies care about shows through.</li>
  <li>Work is a big part of love, and love should be a big part of work. Love can be an abstract idea (noun) but in many contexts it connotes a set of small choices we make to consider one another every day in our communication.</li>
  <li>Practical tactics for increasing workplace empathy:
    <ol>
      <li>develop patience</li>
      <li>cultivate perspective; rephrase your intent, focus on understanding, and persist in seeking consensus</li>
      <li>form connections by speaking with clear intent</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kimwms_">Kim Williams</a> got everyone on the same page with a case study of her team’s work on Indeed’s design system. Some insights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s better to have a hundred people who love your product than a million who like it. Starting there can pay dividends.</li>
  <li>Design systems are so great because they’re a documented and realized instantiation of so many practice areas that intersect to allow customer centricity: brand identity systems, content strategy, design engineering, discovery and insights, research, design ops, product design, etc.</li>
  <li>Across different domains of organizational praxis, innovation emerges from the summative constraints of what’s desirable, feasible, and viable.</li>
</ul>

</figure>

<p>Yesenia Perez-Cruz talked about increasing the efficacy of a design system by intelligently utilizing context as a constraint that shapes its focus and intent. She moved through a <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/yeseniaperezcruz/building-flexible-design-systems">case study</a> of how <a href="https://www.vox.com/">Vox</a> pursued a design system that balances the needs of multiple brands and web properties. Key points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t start with components—they need context and purpose. Start with language because it shapes content and addresses people. Starting there helps orient systems around semantic differences rather than presentational ones.</li>
  <li>All patterns should solve specific problems rather than aiming to create a one-size-fits-all solution. Avoid developing patterns for hypothetical situations.</li>
  <li>In writings on his “atomic design” philosophy, Brad Frost has explicated the UI inventory process from a visual/presentational angle. Perez-Cruz contends that this should be followed by a purpose-driven inventory that identifies the common semantic contexts of UI components.</li>

<p>Adekunle Oduye’s talk focused on the philosophically important details of technical implementation that are key to the cross-functional benefits of a successful design system.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design systems are for <em>people!</em> Successful design systems that are heavily and effectively utilized across an organization properly balance the needs of their producers and consumers.</li>
  <li><em>Process</em> is paramount in the development of a design system in order to align outcomes with goals. It defines how the system compromises with constraints to navigate diverse needs.</li>
  <li><em>Prototyping</em> is a must! “It’s not real until it’s in the code.”

<ul>
  <li>Hom made a case for more thorough efforts in illustrative diversity. She exposed strategies for cultivating deeper interest in others’ experiences and translating them into expressive visual language for a design system.</li>
  <li>She drove home the incredible importance of custom in-house work for high-performing illustration in design systems.</li>
  <li>She didn’t have a committal answer when asked what the best alternative to in-house work was; it is that invaluable. Sometimes, you just need custom work.</li>

<p>Amélie Lamont’s talk made some fascinating connections between design systems and language through the lens of poetry. All the snaps for this one 🫰!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design systems start with language and we should recognize that words have power.</li>
  <li>Language is not neutral or apolitical and employing it usefully requires institutional knowledge and consent from individuals with skin in the game.</li>
  <li>The loudest voices will always be heard, but will they be listened to?</li>

<p>Dan Mall’s talk was <em>FUN!</em> He gave out Dum Dums lollipops for design systems jeopardy 😊🍭. The talk was a compelling look at what design systems can actually do for designers and why we shouldn’t be afraid to push them forward in product-oriented organizations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design systems are probably most heavily utilized by… developers. Designers understandably fear automation and it informs our behind-the-scenes relationship with design systems. But there are silver linings!</li>
  <li>We should be discerning about the things we build into design systems to maximize their utility and ability to scale design at quality within an organization.</li>
  <li>What makes a museum special is what’s not on the walls (a building with everything is just a warehouse).</li>
  <li>Design systems should work on the 80/20 principle: they can be used to reduce design effort on the bulk of repeatable tasks so that designers can focus on high-impact work that requires more nuanced attention to detail. This is the unscalable stuff; the stuff there’s usually no time or budget for, but that can synthesize great design moments.</li>

  <li>When considering a design system as a solution and stating its value to stakeholders designers should begin by gathering data to quantify the value proposition of investing in a systems undertaking.</li>
  <li>“Us vs. them” thinking must disappear; good design systems incorporate the needs of diverse producers and consumers both within and outside of an organization. Strategic partnerships are necessary for success and that requires compromise and negotiation.</li>
  <li>Orgs should invest heavily in the build process and treat delivery as a service or product to be designed. Components don’t create value until live in a production environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>John Maeda followed up on Horvath’s momentum with a personal, humorous, and inspiringly philosophical take on where we are with design systems as 2018 comes to a close.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We’ve reached the stage of negotiating fluency in thinking about and creating design systems (it happened with stylesheets, responsive design, and many other technology paradigms before).</li>
  <li>Design systems are a wonderful tool for enforcing organizational collaboration and finally killing <a href="https://stedmanhalliday.com/blog/2017/11/22/toxic-design-community">auteur theory in design.</a> I’ll let you wait for the recap to hear the rest!</li>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Clarity was a blast! On top of all the great talks mentioned in this summary, there were workshops, happy hours with lightning talks, tech demos, and an after-party with a sweet view on the top floor of the New Museum (check out the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/clarityconf/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=2250831095129369">photo album</a>). A very special thanks to Jina and all of the other organizers, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers for pouring a bunch of love into organizing an event where so many amazing voices could be heard. Thanks to Figma and Katie Gregorio as well for selecting me for the conference scholarship!</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>I’m a community manager at <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/designguild">Designers Guild</a> where we just completed a pilot run of Facebook’s new Mentorship feature (currently being tested in Groups and Pages). As part of our trial—along with setting up some organizational resources and gathering feedback—I participated in our 8-week, 6-step program as a mentee with a small cohort of other members who applied for the program.</p>

<p>Brad Monahan also moderates Designers Guild and agreed to help out by participating in the program as my mentor. Serendipitously, Brad is also a design manager at Uber and providing direction for designers’ career growth is a core function of his role there. Something that Brad and I began discussing early on is the kind of environment I’d like to work in for the next phase of my design career.</p>

<p>One thing that piqued my interest was the particular way in which Brad described his own job. He doesn’t see moving into management so much as ceasing to design but instead described it as designing different things (teams) to achieve impact in different ways. He unraveled this thread a bit for me and introduced me to a book called <em>Org Design for Design Orgs</em> and the emerging field of design operations (aka <em>design ops</em>). I ended up watching a couple of talks by the authors and annotating them for homework that week.</p>

<h2 id="org-design-notes-from-peter-merholz">Org Design Notes from Peter Merholz</h2>

<h3 id="org-designs-general-philosophy">Org Design’s General Philosophy</h3>

<p>Merholz contends that service design is the best lens to peer through in order to understand the core philosophy underlying org design.</p>

<blockquote class="bigquote">
All design is service design.
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Many customer touch points occur throughout a <em>journey</em>.</li>
  <li>Design can inform and drive a diverse set of business processes such as management, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, sales, and support.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="organizational-models-for-design-teams">Organizational Models for Design Teams</h3>

<p>Organizational models for design teams can vary quite a bit. Merholz splits these into 3 major categories.</p>

<h4 id="centralized-internal-services">Centralized Internal Services</h4>

<p><em>An in-house agency</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>This model is project-based.</li>
  <li>Teams are organized by function.</li>
  <li>Designers are farmed out on projects as needed.</li>
</ul>

<figure>
<img alt="centralized internal services pros and cons" src="/assets/img/2018-11-30-table-0.webp" />
<figcaption>Common pros and cons of the centralized internal services model</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4 id="decentralized--embedded">Decentralized &amp; Embedded</h4>

<p><em>Everyone gets a designer; pods in squads</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>This model is program-based.</li>
  <li>Designers are embedded as core team members.</li>
  <li>It’s common for this model to create teams with 1, 2, or few designer(s).</li>
</ul>

<figure>
<img alt="decentralized and embedded pros and cons" src="/assets/img/2018-11-30-table-1.webp" />
<figcaption>Common pros and cons of the decentralized and embedded model</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4 id="centralized-partnership">Centralized Partnership</h4>

<p><em>The best of both worlds</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Senior designers maintain connections to specialized org teams, while not necessarily embedded (i.e. decentralized and embedded model).</li>
  <li>This makes sense since designers will possess deeper vertical skillsets later in their careers.</li>
  <li>Less experienced designers become more modular gears, slotting into project functions as needed (i.e. centralized model).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>It’s clear that Merholz favors compromise when it comes to the structure of design organizations.</strong> He identifies numerous advantages to hybridity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Designers feel supported in their careers, skill development, and daily workplace needs.</li>
  <li>Design teams maintain commitment to products and features.</li>
  <li>Centralization helps maintain a holistic view across the entire customer journey and different segments of the organization.</li>
  <li>Junior designers have mobility after shorter commitments.</li>
  <li>Teams are organized by steps in the customer journey which prevents frequent team reorganization.</li>
</ul>

<p>Skinner identifies three categories of useful qualities in design orgs.</p>

<h4 id="foundation">Foundation</h4>

<p>1. Shared sense of purpose</p>

<p>2. Focused, empowered leadership</p>

<p>3. Authentic user empathy</p>

<p>4. Understand, articulate, and create value</p>

<p>7. Establish and uphold standards of quality</p>

<p>8. Value delivery over perfection</p>

<h4 id="management">Management</h4>

<p>9. Treat team members as people, not resources</p>

<p>10. Diversity of perspective and background</p>

<p>11. Foster a collaborative environment</p>

<p>12. Manage operations effectively</p>

<h3 id="decision-making">Decision Making</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Half the decisions in organizations fail.</em></p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Fragmented decision making can have an outsized impact.</strong></p>

<p>Here are some study results on the number of viable solutions to business problems generated from different decision-making processes (ranked):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identifying performance gaps</li>
  <li>Goal setting</li>
  <li>Problem solving</li>
  <li>Leader makes decisions</li>
</ol>

<p>More inclusive and participatory management styles yield more solutions.</p>

  <li>Focuses on structure and surface of design solutions</li>
  <li>Examples: interaction design, visual design, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="mt-200">Stage 2: Full Team</h4>

<ul>
  <li>This stage may add more product designers.</li>
  <li>The team now consists of 5–7 people.</li>
  <li>Specialized hires are brought on (not limited to the examples below):</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="content-strategist">Content Strategist</h5>

<p>Responsible for <strong>voice and tone</strong>, content structure, and copywriting</p>

<p>This is a <strong>generative and evaluative</strong> role that is ideally <strong>highly leveraged throughout the org.</strong></p>

<h5 id="head-of-design-revisited">Head of Design (revisited)</h5>

<p>At this stage it’s common for HoD’s to struggle with scale and cede the role to directors with more experience.</p>

<h4 class="mt-200">Stage 4: Coordinated Org</h4>

<p>This stage is primarily focused on managing scale-related complexity.</p>

<h5 id="service-designer">Service Designer</h5>

<p>This manager focuses on <strong>practice, communication, and prioritization,</strong> working towards an overall objective of <strong>organizational effectiveness.</strong></p>

<h4 class="mt-200">Stage 5: Distributed Leadership</h4>

<p>This is the final growth taxonomy of design organizations in Skinner’s model.</p>

<h5 id="design-director">Design Director</h5>

<p>This leader oversees a swath of <strong>experiences across teams.</strong></p>

<h5 id="creative-director">Creative Director</h5>

<p>This leader establishes <strong>quality standards</strong> via <strong>creative leadership.</strong></p>

<p>In case you haven’t heard, MailChimp is now Mailchimp. That’s right, it’s #rebrand season! Get an overview of what’s new on <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90241616/see-mailchimps-weird-new-branding"><em>Fast Company</em></a> and dive in a little deeper at <a href="https://mailchimp.com/design/">Mailchimp Design</a>.</p>

<p><em>This article was inspired by a thread in <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/designguild">Designers Guild</a>, a Facebook community that I help moderate. Designers Guild consists of 10,000+ designers committed to discussing, learning, and growing together. Jon Bell (Senior Design Manager at Mailchimp) unveiled the company’s fresh rebrand (with support from Collins and R/GA) and asked the community for its thoughts. After digging into the work a little and sleeping on it yesterday, I had the opportunity to prepare some more fleshed out opinions this morning (prompted by Jenny Earnest).</em></p>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h2 id="freddie-forever">Freddie Forever!</h2>

<p>It’s nice when a rebrand can preserve the iconic elements of a company’s history, so I like that Mailchimp kept Freddie as a logo. The lockups with the new wordmark also look fantastic; they preserve the lighthearted quality of the old script logotype, but find harmony with Freddie’s weightier aesthetic. The team nailed the logo portion of this rebrand.</p>

<figure>
<img alt="Mailchimp animation" src="/assets/img/2018-09-27-mailchimp-animation.gif" />
<figcaption>Mailchimp’s new logo lockup (now with 🔥 inktraps)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I enjoy how the other design elements (such as typography and illustration) coalesce and the Cavendish swatch dignifies everything pretty nicely. The aesthetic gestures are very appreciable on the surface, but after some more consideration, I’m not 100% convinced that the design supports the right message for Mailchimp. Perhaps this is more a critique of the marketing considerations of this rebrand (as opposed to the design ones).</p>

<h2 id="identity-a-balancing-act">Identity: A Balancing Act</h2>

<p>A brand’s identity isn’t solely determined by its stakeholders; it’s negotiated with an audience over the brand’s lifetime. One of the most difficult aspects of rebranding is balancing the internal desire to redefine a company’s communication strategy with the need resonate with customers, representing their shared history and experiences with the brand. Mailchimp’s choice of a primary marketing message may make that somewhat difficult.</p>

<h3 id="the-overarching-message">The Overarching Message</h3>

<p>From Mailchimp Design:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mailchimp has always been a little bit different… We want to show our customers that building a successful business means <strong>staying true to yourself.</strong> With this brand identity and design system, we hope to inspire them to be bold and creative with their own brands.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-design-decisions">The Design Decisions</h3>

<p>The overarching message of staying true to yourself and being bold and creative are primarily supported by the following new design elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the rough, expressive, and naïve illustration style</li>
  <li>Cooper Light: a quirky typeface with a correspondingly odd vernacular history (“You may have seen its larger cousin on dusty old funk records and inside questionable sandwich shops.”)</li>
</ul>

<figure>
<img alt="Mailchimp qualities" src="/assets/img/2018-09-27-mailchimp-qualities.webp" />
<figcaption>Bold and creative to be sure… but is Mailchimp staying true to itself?</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h2 id="the-disconnect">The Disconnect</h2>

<p><strong>The biggest potential issue with Mailchimp’s rebrand is that it doesn’t strongly connect its new marketing message to the value proposed by its existing portfolio of products and services.</strong> The pitch for customers to <em>be bold and creative</em> presents a vision that is perhaps too wide and ambitious to resonate powerfully with real customer goals in the present. It seems as if Mailchimp is paying more attention to who or what it wants to be to its customers than to what customers expect and desire from its offerings.</p>

<p>Take a look at Mailchimp’s current products. To be fair, the email and landing page templates are key offerings that are indeed geared towards creative empowerment, but how easily does something like segmentation inspire boldness and creativity? In contrast, how many of these products and services are concerned with helping businesses reach people in better ways? (<em>Hint: literally, all of them are about that.</em>)</p>

<figure>
<img alt="Mailchimp portfolio" src="/assets/img/2018-09-27-mailchimp-portfolio.webp" />
<figcaption>Here’s what Mailchimp actually offers customers.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At present, the primary marketing message (and as a result, the look and feel of the rebrand) seem somewhat out-of-touch with what Mailchimp actually <em>does</em> (or rather, what it has done historically). With email marketing having been the company’s bread and butter and the central touchpoint for its customers since its inception, it’s not hard to imagine some other directions the rebrand could have gone in.</p>

<p>The concept of mail and traditional postage’s historical role in cementing human connections are ripe with readymade marketing metaphors for how a business can improve communications with its customers. Plenty of the playful design language that the agencies ultimately landed on can be housed under marketing messages more concerned with what the company actually offers: business solutions for reaching people.</p>

<p>When it comes to examples of brands that have navigated this divide adeptly, I think back to the popular G Suite advertisement which imagines Hall &amp; Oates collaborating on the lyrics to <em>Maneater</em> in Google Docs. The message resonated well with customers because it included the spirit of originality and playfulness that Mailchimp is clearly after with this rebrand. However, it did so without deviating from the central value prop of the product: collaborative word processing.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="more-than-email">More Than Email</h2>

<p>At this point, it’s pretty clear that Mailchimp is seeking to define itself beyond the confines of the email marketing niche (they even said so). It also seems somewhat ironic that they chose to focus on inspiring and enabling creativity when that focus is disconnected from the parts of the business which practically extend beyond email: connection, automation, and optimization.</p>

<figure>
<img alt="more than email" src="/assets/img/2018-09-27-more-than-email.webp" />

<p>David Martinez also made a solid point about the rebrand appearing to understate the company’s success in the email marketing niche. Mailchimp’s new approach doesn’t seem very reflective of the actual impact and scale of one of (if not) the largest email marketing platforms on the web experiencing daily growth on the order of 14K+ customers. The rebrand may be just as incongruent with what users want and expect out of the company’s products.</p>

<p>Is it fair to ask why Mailchimp feels the need to aggressively outgrow its roots? Is the company failing to embrace its own stated brand value of staying true to itself? It’s great that Mailchimp wants to inspire originality in brands that adopt it for marketing, but what if that’s not the value prop that customers are connecting with?</p>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>

<p>Pressing questions aside, I’m inclined to give Mailchimp the benefit of the doubt overall. Aiming to inspire originality and creativity instead of simply helping businesses reach people with better marketing services is an ambitious endeavor to say the least, and I respect that. It’s a bold decision to eschew the more banal SaaS marketing and branding tropes in favor of a mission that means something important to Mailchimp’s team and their story. The caveat is that I’m not sure whether or not a new brand identity and design system alone are enough to inspire users in that fashion.</p>

<blockquote class="bigquote">
If Mailchimp truly desires to be more than mail and empower creativity, its product offerings may need to evolve in tandem with its new brand philosophy.
</blockquote>

<p>Design templates are a start, but will Mailchimp introduce any new offerings to truly assist brands in finding and crafting their bold, courageous, creative, and authentic voices? Only time will tell, but I’m excited to see what unfolds since the company has teased more to come. It’s clear that Mailchimp has embraced the decisions underlying its new brand identity as a living set of principles intended to evolve with the business instead of edicts set in stone and that’s a very good thing.</p>

<p>Congrats to all teams involved with the new rollout!</p>

<p><em>Cool news: I’ve been working with the leadership team at Designers Guild to launch an online mentorship program this September. Designers Guild is a community of 10,000+ designers committed to discussing, learning, and growing together. The outpouring of interest in our upcoming program (over 400 pupils and 100 mentors have applied) encouraged us to open up a dialogue about mentorship expectations and experiences. Here are some of my stories.</em></p>

<h2 id="my-first-mentor">My first mentor</h2>

<p>My first mentorship experience began after I started contracting freelance design work in high school. (This was the start of my design career around eight or nine years ago.) After a couple years of independently learning how to design and code, a friend’s dad commissioned me to produce a website for his legal firm. I was around 15 years old and it was my first freelance gig. It went well and I quickly landed another project via referral, this one with a senior designer on it.</p>

<p>This designer—who became my first mentor—was in his 50s with a lot of more traditional agency experience. Our communication styles meshed well and we got along instantly. My skillset complemented his experience well. He would handle the clients, lead design direction, manage projects, and present work. I filled in the gaps with my knowledge of technology and new media. We’ve worked together on a lot of projects since.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>I learned about the administrative and hustling aspects of freelance work; my communication skills with clients and collaborators flourished.</li>
  <li>I gained a ton of confidence and experience through immersion.</li>
  <li>I began a long relationship with someone who remains an important part of my professional support network.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>There was a generational gap between our hard skillsets.</li>
  <li>I didn’t frequently get opportunities to push the limits of my skills or creative sensibilities.</li>
  <li>Some of the work and clients became less appealing over the years as my interests matured; I sought more opportunities for growth.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-second-mentor">My second mentor</h2>

<p>It was the summer after my first year of design school and I’d been working alongside my first mentor for a couple years. It surprised me to learn that his wife was a renowned food photographer. He got me a second job managing her studio while I worked a design internship. Despite not being a designer, she became my second mentor. I learned far more from her than at my internship that summer.</p>

<p>My old mentor left agency life behind for a more flexible freelance routine, but his wife was the hardest hustler I had ever met. Alongside shooting, she ran a brick-and-mortar studio that doubled as an event space. She had a lot more administrative overhead to manage. She set the bar high for me and pushed me very hard, but never failed to praise and reward me when I met her expectations.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>I learned a ton about entrepreneurship and the day-to-day details of running a business (versus freelancing).</li>
  <li>Managing and facilitating larger on-site productions became second nature. Necessity forced me to learn many things quickly.</li>
  <li>I began to understand that I liked providing value more than making things. I felt most rewarded when my skills worked in tandem to maximize the value I could provide.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>My hard skills and career trajectory were even more misaligned than they were with my previous mentor.</li>
  <li>Working two jobs led to my first experience with burnout the following semester.</li>
  <li>I possessed neither the foresight nor soft skills to make lasting connections in a parallel creative industry.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-last-mentor">My last mentor</h2>

<p>My last mentor was assigned to me in design school. In hindsight, I didn’t have the social/emotional maturity to take full advantage of that relationship. The fact that school was a more pressurized environment exacerbated this. I loved my mentor’s energy as a person, but her communication style wasn’t compatible with mine. I felt that she was rather abstract and indirect at times. Even though I studied graphic design in a program of my choice, the perfect mentor was elusive. Finding someone with a matching philosophy, skillset, and communication style was difficult. Prompted by our skillset incongruence, my mentor instructed me to seek other advisors. This became an obstacle to transparency, resulting in negative feedback on important work.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>She bolstered my focus on ethics. She once said she’d eat canned soup every night if it meant she got to do the work that made her proud.</li>
  <li>She never stopped encouraging me to write.</li>
  <li>I grew after-the-fact by learning from my failures.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Our communication styles were incompatible.</li>
  <li>Our philosophies, skills, and career trajectories were somewhat mismatched.</li>
  <li>The pressurized environment and academic consequences led to a decline in my confidence.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="key-takeaways-from-my-mentorship-experiences">Key takeaways from my mentorship experiences</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>One of the most crucial aspects of a mentor-pupil relationship is communicative compatibility.</strong> Ideas don’t mean anything (or may even become harmful) when lost in translation.</li>
  <li><strong>Experience is the best teacher.</strong> Sometimes, it’s quite important that a mentor has walked the (approximate) path that a pupil would like to take in their career.</li>
  <li>Despite a mismatch in hard skills or career trajectory, a pupil can still learn a lot from a mentor. <strong>Sometimes what complements a pupil’s hard skills and fills in the gaps can be just as—if not more—important to their long-term success.</strong></li>
  <li>A good mentor will challenge pupils, hold them accountable, and examine failures to create teachable moments, but will also <strong>remember to reward and praise pupils, emphasizing their strengths.</strong></li>
  <li>Good mentors usually ask a lot of questions before giving advice. <strong>Inquiry before judgment is a strong general principle for teachers.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Pupils are responsible for pulling the best out of their mentors</strong>—not just the other way around. Pupils must be proactive and learn to actively solicit mentor input to meet their unique needs.</li>
</ul>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<p>My most recent relationship with a mentor was my most difficult, but I may have grown the most from it. I learned how to be more proactive and ask for what I need. I realized how important a good cultural and environmental fit is to the success of individuals and institutions. I learned about my limitations and what I could do to address them.</p>

<p>Overall, my experiences have left me with a desire for a mentor whose philosophy, experience, and goals more closely match my interests. I’m at a point in my career where I know a bit more about what I want than I did in design school. Failing that, at least I know which questions I’ve got to ask to find the right answers. Finding a strong fit and learning from community feedback are what I’m most excited about when it comes to starting a new mentorship program.</p>

<p>I’d like to conclude this story with some wisdom from Sister Corita Kent: a notable educator in the arts. Below are her famous rules for the Immaculate Heart College Art Department. Many of them apply to relationships between mentors and pupils.</p>

<figure>
<img alt="Sister Corita Kent's ten rules" src="/assets/img/2018-08-27-ten-rules.webp" />
</figure>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>RULE 1: Find a place you trust, and then try trusting it for awhile.</em></p>

  <p><em>RULE 2: General duties of a student — pull everything out of your teacher; pull everything out of your fellow students.</em></p>

  <p><em>RULE 3: General duties of a teacher — pull everything out of your students.</em></p>

  <p><em>RULE 4: Consider everything an experiment.</em></p>

  <p><em>RULE 5: Be self-disciplined — this means finding someone wise or smart and choosing to follow them. To be disciplined is to follow in a good way. To be self-disciplined is to follow in a better way.</em></p>

  <p><em>RULE 6: Nothing is a mistake. There’s no win and no fail, there’s only make.</em></p>

  <p><em>RULE 7: The only rule is work. If you work it will lead to something. It’s the people who do all of the work all of the time who eventually catch on to things.</em></p>

  <p><em>RULE 8: Don’t try to create and analyze at the same time. They’re different processes.</em></p>

  <p><em>RULE 9: Be happy whenever you can manage it. Enjoy yourself. It’s lighter than you think.</em></p>

  <p><em>RULE 10: “We’re breaking all the rules. Even our own rules. And how do we do that? By leaving plenty of room for X quantities.” (John Cage)</em></p>

  <p><em>HELPFUL HINTS: Always be around. Come or go to everything. Always go to classes. Read anything you can get your hands on. Look at movies carefully, often. Save everything — it might come in handy later.</em></p>

  <p><em>There should be new rules next week.</em></p>
