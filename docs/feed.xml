<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>2025 was the second-highest listening year, trailing only the peak of 2022. But what stands out is the variety: 288 unique tracks is the most diverse year yet, suggesting I’m finally catching up with the ever-expanding Skrrt discography.</p>

<p>The top play count dropping from 155 to 50 over five years tells a story: less obsessive looping, more even distribution across the catalog. <em>World Speed</em> earned its crown through consistent rotation rather than manic repetition.</p>

<h3 id="perennial-favorites">Perennial Favorites</h3>

<p>Some tracks just keep showing up year after year:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Scissors Cut It</em></strong> - the only track to appear in the top 22 all five years</li>
  <li><strong><em>Never Nemesis</em></strong> - 2021, 2022, 2024</li>
  <li><strong><em>Ascendant Mode (Speedforce)</em></strong> - went from #1 in 2021 to still charting in 2024</li>
  <li><strong><em>Arbitrary (No Service)</em></strong> - #1 in 2023, still top 10 in 2025</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2025-highlights">2025 Highlights</h3>

<p>This year saw heavy rotation of Skrrt’s two ambient double-albums, which bookend the tracking years: <em>1+2(Ambient)</em> (2021) and <em>3+4(Ambient)</em> (2025). It seems that Yung Skrrt can offer a warm fleece during trying times just as well as a jumper cable shock when life calls for motion. New favorites like <em>Pop Like 3</em>, <em>Icarus Prophecy</em>, and <em>mirrorFaced</em> broke into the rotation alongside returning champions <em>World Speed</em> and <em>In The Back</em>.</p>

I started it during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic, building an instrumental (and later a concept) around a field recording of my mother preparing hot cocoa for me. It took shape slowly, across long intervals of creative stalling and spurts, while I juggled many other projects (I’m a little ashamed it took me five years to the very day, but creative pursuits aren’t always linear and that’s fine). I’m not sure how much I actually like the final product, but I know I don’t hate it. I don’t think it’s pushing a sonic envelope or sitting at some high watermark of intentional craft, but firsts can matter for other reasons. It was important for me to get something out, to finish, to have a anything at all to stand on and move forward from.</p>

<p>With a bit of distance in the reflective wake of finishing something, I’m considering how I might structure a more intentional approach to craft and point it at what I’d like to do next. I’d like that consideration to incorporate an honest appraisal of my abilities, strengths, weaknesses, desires, preferences, habits, cognitive style, and more. I’m curious what I could bring to the songwriting process if I make it my goal to take the largest step I can manage between the completion of this initial work and a next effort (of course without circling the drain with the kind of perfectionism that would protract it all into another five-year process).</p>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h2 id="instrumentalizing-idiosyncrasy">Instrumentalizing idiosyncrasy</h2>

<p>Thesis: my primary instrument is my own nervous system.</p>

<p>What do I know about myself? I think a great deal about everything. I am highly sensitive, aurally and conceptually speaking. I like to explore with ability; I will do as much of everything available to me as decently as I can. I can have bursts of hyperactivity with long reprieves in between for coalescence of ideas. My cognition is associative to a degree that sometimes borders on apophenia, but at its best it weaves compelling, unexpected, indirectly perceptible thematic ties. I like collaborating a lot of the time.</p>

<p>Some of the same traits that give me range also make me annoying to myself on occasion. I do not always have a strong bias for engaging creative activity. I don’t always communicate in ways that can be understood or felt well… I know I’m not for everyone. I am terribly distractible at times and very focused at others; there’s a bifurcation that mostly points to ADHD or hyper-fixation as attractor states and I need to strategize exploits to make those modes or any in-betweenness operable. I am unlikely to explore productively at length without some payoff matrix or feedback loop that converges on usable outcomes.</p>

<p>I can be a directional perfectionist, but that’s far from deterministic. Sometimes I fixate extremely to the detriment of overall productivity. Other times “good enough” is exactly that and I refuse to explore further even when I think it likely that deeper effort would improve something. Collaboration, critique, and clear evaluation frameworks can be salves here, but I also value control too much to be an ideal collaborator with surefire consistency.</p>

<p>Accordingly, my songwriting system needs to be designed around those realities. My strengths and weaknesses are not moral verdicts. They are structural constraints. My goal is to let the strengths run while putting rails around the weaknesses so the whole thing still pushes songs out instead of everything just swirling around in my head indefinitely.</p>

<p>Operating atop idiosyncrasy isn’t just about theoretic or cognitive approaches to songwriting; it concerns the practical in equal measure. If the goal is to output real songs that resonate, it’s not enough to accommodate my inner workings. I also have to map what lands as part of the listening experience. That means intentionally monitoring and investigating other listeners’ subjective experiences and listening closely when they tell me what stands out to them. It means seeking both casual and critical feedback frequently, honing in on signal, and folding that back into considerations that inform process.</p>

<p>Although I am in some ways early in my songwriting journey, a number of throughlines have already surfaced. Listeners have highlighted themes like baritone vocal delivery (especially how it’s less expected alongside modern pop sensibilities and arrangements), and layered textures and approaches to stereo space that give arrangements depth. People take note of an especially percussive approach to rhythm that brings a powerful sense of motion to compositions. A few have spontaneously remarked that <em>cocoa</em> evokes images of the same environment in their minds, converging on a specific flavor of nostalgia connotatively carried by instrumentation, sound design, and other elements of the sonic palette.</p>

<p>While I’m obviously aware that all of these elements are present and their inclusions are intentional, some of the specific effects they’ve had on others’ listening experiences are not purposeful, nor are they things I would’ve guessed at first. I’m not even sure I necessarily agree with some evaluations or that I even wholly enjoy some of the elements that draw others’ attention, but I’m still able to take it on faith that there is exploitable signal in the feedback and tension there that can add to a kind of reverse-engineered, self-reflective taste.</p>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h2 id="differential-generative-capacities">Differential generative capacities</h2>

<p>My mind and my words tend to greatly outpace my hands in generative capacity.</p>

<p>I produce a lot of ideas, tie them together, remix them, and can scaffold temples from thoughts and language (I didn’t say they always stand upright). I enjoy elegant solutions to dense conceptual puzzles. I like the constraint of casting my pet ideas as molds to shape the building blocks of a system. I can then trace paths through the resulting maze, where structure emerges from a blend of semiotic connection, clever invention, and organic assembly (like water flowing downhill).</p>

<p>The flip side is that my tendency to produce tangible outcomes through manual processes other than writing is inversely low-volume. I tend to prune concepts by way of mental modeling and defensive pessimism, dimensionally limit my real-world experimentation, and put forward a few tangible solutions to compare and advance. I naturally choose considered elegance over brute force or breadth and that is not always what creative output needs. It’s antithetical to the <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2020/12/10/quantity-leads-to-quality-the-origin-of-a-parable/">pottery class parable</a> that stresses quantity of production as the most reliable path to quality, but I naturally value <em>work smart</em> over <em>work hard</em> under conditions of manipulable uncertainty.</p>

<p>Rather than trying to become a largely different kind of person after a decades-long personal and professional history of creative output, I can assume my tendencies will remain somewhat baked-in if they haven’t changed by now (the needle has moved, but not some immense distance that portends an eventual grand shift in my nature). Resultantly, my theory of songwriting should treat cognitive productivity as my main fuel source and then build mechanisms that convert that fuel into creative output without overextending me in weak dimensions. The question is not <em>how do I think less?</em> but rather <em>how do I let my thinking do more of the heavy lifting while the system passively handles output?</em></p>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h2 id="structure-and-substrate">Structure and substrate</h2>

<p>Charlie Kaufman’s deconstruction of crazed auteurism in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synecdoche,_New_York"><em>Synecdoche, New York</em></a> seems central to how I think about an important part of the creative process. Protagonist Caden Cotard’s conceit is to pour the entirety of his twisted angst, selfhood, and the world around him that informs it all into his ludicrously grand and absurdly realistic theater production. The MacArthur Fellowship he’s received may validate his creative ability by proxy through its “Genius Grant” reputation, but practically speaking from the eyes of an uninformed observer in the diegesis, the guy’s an absolute fucking kook with a mess of a life on fire. Without the colossal warehouse to contain the manifestation of his ideas and realize his work inside, he would perceptually remain a kook. Worse, he’d be a crank: unable to produce anything of value at all (let alone in his chosen medium) with only his insanity and pitiable selfhood to show for all his supposedly brilliant creative impulses.</p>

<p>It seems obvious to me that my creative success or failure with grander ideas hinges on securing a “warehouse” of my own. The ideas need to flow into something expressive that isn’t <em>just</em> language. The executional distance to human performance in the chosen medium is also often too large to be tractable given the volume of my cognitive creative impulses and comparatively meager average manual productivity. I am trying to build a workable sink for neuroses and narratives. Maybe over time, a more elegant model emerges with canals, levees, moving locks, and modulated flows; something that orders and organizes chaos and entropy.</p>

<p>It is crucially important for me to understand the difference between pouring water into the apparatus and watching it behave beautifully versus trying to construct the apparatus out of water itself. I suspect I’ve been trying to accomplish the latter more as of late and I intend to stop. Conversely, I realize I don’t always have to fix the game, but if I neglect to choose which one I’m playing at all on the other hand… well, good luck to me, I guess.</p>

<p>Takeaway: find a good “warehouse” to work in. Find a good sink to throw ideas inside where they can clump together and assume naturally stable shapes to engage in further play.</p>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h2 id="evolving-the-writing-approach">Evolving the writing approach</h2>

<h3 id="1-structure-first-coloring-inside-the-lines">1. Structure first: coloring inside the lines</h3>

<p>The conventional approach and my initial one goes something like this: part to whole, then color inside the lines with sonic ideas and other parts that make sense. Arrangement structure constrains ideas, ornament adorns foundational structure, sometimes the mutual interplay changes things along the way. It’s all rather intentional and relatively linear, repeatable, predictable, yet still uniquely challenging and variable a bunch of the time.</p>

<p>For me, some of this changes from song to song, but in general this method is too dimensionally reductive given my limited productive capacity. It requires a lot of organic experimentation to drive results that work exceptionally well while still feeling surprising. That kind of open-ended trial and error is exactly where I lose steam.</p>

<p>I can get some of that activation energy for experimentation from collaboration, but I also lose control there in ways that can be undesirable. I rely on happy accidents too much within this frame. It can be a stable setup that churns out good things but it’s far from optimal given what I know my strengths to be.</p>

<p>In other words: a pure structure-first approach does not fully harness my associative mind and it leans heavily on behaviors which I do not reliably execute.</p>

<h3 id="2-motif-and-concept-first-solving-the-puzzle-backwards">2. Motif and concept first: solving the puzzle backwards</h3>

<p>I’m interested in making some macroscopic changes to my writing process and exploring different tactics. I can collect and log conceptual and sonic motifs that will eventually constrain structure through how they most naturally assemble and complement or contrast with one another. I can treat songwriting as a puzzle solved both backwards and inside-out, working from a globally formless yet locally characterizable solution set to determine the shape of the maze, how the turns are juxtaposed, what surfaces the motifs show up on, and how their quality is affected.</p>

<p>This lets my cognitive capacity stand in for the productive kind. My music starts to make itself around and between broader ideas. I do not know exactly what it will sound like at the start, but I can listen carefully to make sure it works. I get to use my ears like my audience, a collaborator, or a critic and still surprise myself while scratching my other real itch: linguistic and conceptual play. I get to have my cake and eat it too.</p>

<p>In this mode, structure is not a prefab cage I drop fitting ideas into. Instead, form emerges from the way motifs interact. My ideas are not loose anymore nor are they rigid, they become the molds for the building blocks, and the song’s architecture crystallizes around their intersections.</p>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h2 id="recombination-and-reinvigoration">Recombination and reinvigoration</h2>

<p>One of the more concrete tools here is deliberate recombination of known inputs.</p>

<p>I can get additional variation by taking my favorite established inputs and swapping intermediary outputs and recombination mechanisms. The aim is fresh yet familiar outputs. There is something special about achieving timelessness by making what is old feel new again.</p>

<p>For instance, I can define formulas based on recombination of specific influences, genre interpolation, instrumentation, sonic palettes, performance techniques, production workflows, arrangement styles, content (conceptual, lyrical, narrative), vocal delivery, and more.</p>

<p>The important part is not the exact recipe but the fact that it <em>is</em> a recipe. I can predefine these assembly lines and treat them as reusable compositional operators. I can take these down to a more granular level too: e.g., sound design, processing chains, synthesis… the list goes on. I don’t have to wait for fusion or spirited and sensible reinvention to occur by accident. I can specify transform pipelines up front (rather than intended outcomes): progression style, rhythmic grid, instrumentation palette, textural paradigm, and modern dynamic or arrangement vocabularies.</p>

<p>For a given song, I can plug a new emotional or conceptual motif informed by my real-world subjective experience and narrative into one of these pipelines, see what falls out, and play with it until it’s hitting right and even surprises me in some radical ways that yield special moments. The “new” quality comes from which motif I introduce and how I tweak the parameters, not from reinventing the entire stylistic frame.</p>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h2 id="engineering-serendipity">Engineering serendipity</h2>

<p>From the outside, this might look like forcing happy accidents. But that phrase does not quite describe what I am actually seeking to rely on in this new paradigm.</p>

<p>What I am really doing is designing a process that surfaces latent stimuli which converge on euphonic consonance while also carrying deliberate conceptual or emotional connotations. The form might accumulate variance because it has a strange pattern of appearing as an end before becoming the means before once again becoming the end, but the shuffling is carefully designed into the process.</p>

<p>I expect to find these moments and I’m surveying for them in advance. Like an archaeological team that hypothesizes the yield of a planned dig, I can have a solid idea of what I expect to find and still be quite surprised. However, the character of the discoveries and the process that shapes them are important. Although I’d hesitate to call it a happy accident, the nature of surprise of an unsuspecting man unearthing a body while doing yard work outside a home he purchased three years ago is quite different. I am engineering manifestation of inventiveness through intersection here. I am concerned with planned discoveries, not random blessings from the muse (although there is plenty of room for that to trickle in as well). Sometimes an uninformed audience might not be able to discern one from the other, but this is largely irrelevant to the itches I’m attempting to scratch. I seek to satisfy myself with my processes.</p>

<p>Surprise should be frequently present, but it will live inside or emerge from a search space that I have architected with deep intention. My job is to design that space and then curate and manipulate the outputs it throws back at me.</p>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h2 id="maturity-limits-and-self-knowledge">Maturity, limits, and self-knowledge</h2>

<p>One nice thing about aging (temporally and creatively) is that I’ve tried enough things to know what I am naturally quite bad at and unlikely to improve upon without deliberate workarounds. There is a kind of maturity that trades the promise of infinite potential for acceptance of limitations and a level of self-knowledge that leads to real efficacy.</p>

<p>I am not going to become the person who happily runs fifty takes a day for six months straight just to “see what happens.” I <em>can</em> do that occasionally in some pursuits, but it is far from my default. I am not always going to communicate my ideas in the simplest way for others. I am going to overthink… I guarantee it. I am going to oscillate between being distractible and entering deep fixation. I am going to care about control.</p>

<p>The theory, then, is not about purging those traits. It is about routing around them and along with their grooves, using them as fuel. I can carve out time for apparatus-building and alternate that with separate, short, discrete sessions for pouring water into the system. I can collaborate where my weaknesses are most costly and protect my need for control where surrender would point me to shutting down. I can accept that my brain wants to build temples of thought and then make sure those temples have doors an actual song can walk through.</p>

<p>I am hoping that this kind of maturity improves my productivity in the years to come, creative and otherwise. Even if my raw energy declines a little, the efficiency of the apparatus can increase. That’s the benefit I expect from compounding self-knowledge and practice. Some might even call it wisdom.</p>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<p>That is my personal theory of songwriting right now: a way of turning an associative, overthinking, intermittently focused brain into a working compositional engine. It will change, but at least it gives me something solid to pour water into for the time being. I’m happy to get back to work with that sketched out. Got any of your own thoughts about songwriting or music of your own that you’d like to share?

<p>Evian Christ thrives on elevating sound design in electronic music, weaving between the familiar and alien. <em>Xkyrgios</em> continues his exploration of atmospheric textures and unconventional rhythmic structures, building tension through restraint. The approach feels architectural, each element deliberately placed, contributing to a larger sonic structure that reveals itself slowly.</p>

<p>The track embodies the kind of forward-thinking electronic music that doesn’t announce its innovations loudly but instead lets them emerge through careful listening. Evian Christ understands that the most compelling electronic music often happens in the gaps between genres, and <em>Xkyrgios</em> occupies that space with confidence and purpose in a way that feels worthy of a soundtrack.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Gimme Half</em>—The Devil Wears Prada</h3>

<p><em>Gimme Half</em> makes this month’s list in recognition of Daniel Williams: longtime drummer of The Devil Wears Prada who perished in a sudden plane crash a week ago. I learned to drum along to this track and many of the others on <em>With Roots Above and Branches Below</em>. Williams just smacks the kit almost all the way through; the momentum is aggressive and many of the rolling fills are very stimulating to play.</p>

<p>The record represents an apotheosis of aughts metalcore’s more melodic and commercial flavors in both style and production. Roots is pretty much a snapshot of the moment immediately before Joey Sturgis’s Foundation sound felt overproduced and more artificial than ideally maximal. Clean vocals are quite tuned, studio arrangement doesn’t let up often, and the drums are triggered almost to hell, but retain enough feel to punch through very satisfactorily. This LP turns those knobs about as high as they can go before listenability dives sharply—I’m looking forward to banging out a full playthrough in a newly renovated drum room in honor of Daniel. Anyone who’s encouraged me to play more music deserves that tribute.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>World Speed</em>—Yung Skrrt</h3>

<p>Yung Skrrt has been sitting in a lane all his own for a long time: fiercely independent, wildly syncretic, and unapologetically individual. Maybe sonic exploration this broad and unfiltered is a natural consequence of embracing production as a live performance: Skrrt cuts about a thousand tracks a year in front of a livestream audience on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/yungskrrt">Twitch</a>, streaming every single day (he’s live as I’m writing this). It’s clear that the man’s primary reason for making at this point is for his own entertainment and appreciation, and that’s special.</p>

<p>Plenty of Skrrt’s work falls back on a tried and true formula, but there are so many nuggets of novelty sprinkled throughout his very expansive catalog. It’s clear from his live-production broadcasts that his approach is more gestural than compositional and prioritizes feel despite being very fundamentally digital—the man really <em>plays</em> the laptop. Throw a literal fortune wheel of genre into the process and you get some deliciously unexpected moments. Some hit immediately, others grow on you over time, some get recycled in a place they fit much better… it’s like Yung Skrrt’s process and music are a sonic clearinghouse for a plethora of ideas that work in more tightly curated releases. More often than some might expect, he is your favorite producer’s favorite producer.</p>

<p><em>World Speed</em> has some real earworm qualities for these reasons. It’s on one of Skrrt’s <em>Half Words</em> projects which play fast and loose with partial lyrical motifs crooned through heavy autotune that would be more at home in an Internet parody of a Playboi Carti reference track. It keeps the listener in a state of keeping up right from the moment a jarring tone cluster blows through a traditional shimmering synth intro characteristic of a Skrrt track. The 808 pattern on this one is something else entirely. I didn’t like it at first but I kept revisiting it in an attempt to wrap my head around syncopation so zany that it feels like a polyrhythmic locomotive. It got its hooks into me and I can’t get enough of it now. Who would do this in a song and why? Which other artist is punching in with bars about sipping yerba mate like a double cup? This guy is utterly peerless; true one of one.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Genie on My Back</em>—ICYTWAT</h3>

<p>ICYTWAT’s sound is tough and ethereal at the same time in a way that’s frequently hypnotic. The haunting minor string melodies on this track sound right out of a medieval RPG or a title like <em>Silent Hill</em> while the drums knock with a kick that can make a room shake. Perfect soundtrack to lift or walk around to when I can’t bring myself to care about anything at all.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Childhood</em>—Kensuke Ushio</h3>

<p>There’s something simply moving about the way that Kensuke Ushio approaches emotional storytelling through sound. <em>Childhood</em> carries the same delicate weight as many of his other iconic soundtracks as a piece that feels like memory itself: fragile, nostalgic, and achingly beautiful.</p>

<p>Ushio’s background in both classical piano and electronic music shines through here. The track manages to be both intimate and expansive, capturing something universal about the bittersweet nature of looking back. It’s the kind of composition that makes you pause whatever you’re doing and just listen as it picks up a click tempo an swings around to its gently swelling resolution.</p>

<iframe class="mt-50" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6e22PmNxZbDR3N8JMe7EvD?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Feather (feat. Cise Starr &amp; Akin from CYNE)</em>—Nujabes</h3>

<p>Musicians who have perished in transportation accidents seems to be a spurious theme this month. Few producers have left as indelible a mark on hip-hop as Nujabes, and <em>Feather</em> stands as one of his most enduring achievements. The way he weaves jazz samples into something entirely new while maintaining respect for both traditions is nothing short of masterful. Cise Starr and Akin deliver verses that feel like conversations with old friends—thoughtful, unpretentious, and deeply human.</p>

<p>The track embodies everything that made Nujabes special: the ability to create music that’s simultaneously nostalgic and forward-thinking, complex and accessible, serious and joyful. More than fifteen years after his passing, <em>Feather</em> still feels like a blueprint for how to honor musical heritage while pushing it into new territory. I’m grateful to my friend Russel for <a href="https://x.com/rslantonie/status/1927335213668983123">priming a full listen of <em>Modal Soul</em></a> as I walked the streets of downtown Chicago in the morning.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Right Now</em>—Mario Abney</h3>

<p>I was pleasurably introduced to Mario Abney’s music at the 50th anniversary show for Andy’s Jazz Club in Chicago where he and his band played with New Orleans legend Donald Harrison Jr. Abney has cultivated a jazz sensibility that feels both rooted in tradition and unafraid to explore new territory. <em>Right Now</em> showcases his ability to create music that’s sophisticated without being pretentious, accessible without being simple. There’s a spiritual quality to the composition that suggests deeper currents running beneath the surface.</p>

<p>The track works on multiple levels—as a showcase for technical skill, as an emotional journey, and as a piece of music that simply feels good to experience. Abney understands that the best jazz has always been about communication, and <em>Right Now</em> is a conversation worth joining right from the beginning as his trumpet talks to a saxophone.</p>

<p>It’s a rare and refreshing thing these days to hear an artist capable of spanning both maximalist pop production and the raw immediacy of stripped-down performance. On <em>WASH2</em>, Jon Bellion dials it all the way back—just voice and piano—and the result is quietly devastating. <em>WASH</em> adds that pop instrumentation and production, but the songwriting and voice on this alternate take are powerful enough to carry all the weight.</p>

<p>Jon’s upcoming album drops in June, and if recent releases and the trailer are any indication, it’s going to be something special. It’s good to see him back and flexing range in a way that still feels grounded.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Deal</em>—Organ Tapes, 500</h3>

<p>I’ve been focusing on vocal production recently in the studio, so I’m listening to vocals with a lot more attention than usual. I’m getting a lot out of a careful ear on tracks where more emphasis is on vibe than vocal performance. Organ Tapes embraces subdued delivery in this way, but I’m emulating a good amount of production technique when it comes to using space in captivating ways: doubling and octaves, different delay and reverb plays on wet vocal chains, panning and tremolo, unique automation throws, etc. There are a lot of fun sounds in here and it’s a nice, relaxed track to skate slowly and carve to when the sun’s out.</p>

<iframe class="mt-50" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/283YMjj2Q6R2C8hKcFDiQb?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>SCREAM</em>—MIKE DEAN</h3>

<p>I’ve come to admire Mike Dean as something like the anti-Rick Rubin. Like Rubin, he’s an industry veteran in his sixties who has dutifully earned his place on hip-hop’s Mount Rushmore of behind-the-scenes architects many times over. But instead of prominently projecting sagely aura, Dean maintains a low profile and a blunt on him at all times. Where Rubin has sported a bald crown with hair on the sides and a Zeus beard, Dean has at times opted for the exact opposite haircut. Rubin claims not to play any instruments (at least adeptly), whereas Dean has at least once casually blurted out that he’s classically trained in a way that seems almost accidental and somewhat antithetical to his image and comportment.</p>

<p>Dean plays multiple instruments but is best known for his analog synth work, often being called the Synth God. Lately, he’s taken to livestreaming his studio improv sessions from a room packed with synths, occasionally shaping those jams into full LPs. His annual <em>420</em> releases collect these moments: expansive, moody, often surprisingly listenable between things. <em>SCREAM</em> is one of the cuts that leans harder into energy. The synths are melodic, dynamic, and gritty in relief against the chill yet incisive drums. Always nice when the Synth God decides to raise his voice a little.</p>

<iframe class="mt-50" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1lQNdXccNyaq4Gsxz3mwMO?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Stylo</em>—Gorillaz feat. Mos Def and Bobby Womack</h3>

<p>Another track with a driving rhythm, synth attack, and an iconic wail. There’s something I really admire about how the bones of Damon Albarn’s process still show through in much of his finished work. You can feel the core loop, the drum machine, the simple idea at its heart, and yet the final product emerges as something entirely fresh, built through sonic iteration and Albarn’s trademark genre syncretism. <em>Stylo</em> is a great example of that sensibility. The hypnotic refrain from Mos Def and the searing, soulful chorus from Bobby Womack take what could have been a mechanical groove and give it emotional life.</p>

<p>There’s an Apple Music interview from a couple years back that captures this simple songwriting approach. Albarn walks Zane Lowe through a studio and casually demos how <em>Clint Eastwood</em> came to be. He reveals that Gorillaz’s breakout single from over two decades ago was basically pulled straight off of the first preset on a Suzuki Omnichord. It doesn’t make the song any worse, as the decisive transformations between that loop and the final track are a masterful way to drive home the idea that simplicity can become greatness. It’s a good reminder that great songs don’t need to be complex—they just need a spark, and the willingness to follow it.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Alba del orate</em>—The Mars Volta</h3>

<p>The Mars Volta’s new record is full of surprises. It moves through jazz, pop, and Latin metal with a fluidity that’s hard to pin down. <em>Alba del orate</em> stands out. The gradual transition into double-timey polyrhythmic jazz percussion and the sudden attack of wobbling saw waves are exciting.</p>

<p>This album feels like a continuous current, flowing from one track to the next with a mix of uncanny cohesion and unexpected turns. There’s something thrilling about how much ground it covers while still feeling so focused. I don’t know what I expected from a new Mars Volta release in 2025, but I’m glad to have heard something that makes it feel like album craft is not a lost art.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Black Dunes (Woman in the Dunes Mix)</em>—This Will Destroy You, Holy Other</h3>

<p><em>Tunnel Blanket</em> is an instrumental record that’s among my favorites, having stood the test of time for nearly 15 years now. Coming in at nearly an hour, it’s a long-form meditative journey through psychedelic transcendence that’s as comforting in some pockets as it is challenging in others. Holy Other’s take on the penultimate track condenses its length considerably and breathes new life and rhythm into it (especially with the crescendo beneath staccato synth leads at the end) while preserving and enhancing the original track’s atmosphere using signature vocal sampling technique.</p>

<iframe class="mt-50" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5yYz39nEuOXpNir7FSB8rA?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Mouse Policy</em>—Cloud Nothings</h3>

<p><em>Mouse Policy</em> barrels forward with Cloud Nothings channelling some of the urgency and youthful garage rock energy that made me fall in love with <em>Attack on Memory</em> back in 2012, but it’s tempered now. It’s more patient and layered with still simple yet more refined songwriting. The chorus soars while the outro glows with a wistful and nostalgic post-rock sparkle.</p>

<p><em>Final Summer</em> is an apt title for this full-length release from last year. Listening to it makes me feel like I’m back in college for a moment: still figuring everything out, still angry for no good reason, still subtly puppeteered by the idea that guitars could save me.</p>

<p>I can never quite predict the lessons I’ll come away from grief with. What seems true over time is that those lessons become easier to learn and that I grow in my ability to accept and process them more readily (even if some fighting and difficulty are involved). For the last few months, loss is something that has been more salient than I’d ideally like it to be, but I’m emerging from it as a stronger person with a more reassured and independent sense of self. I’m grateful for the transformation brought about by having known someone who is now gone; someone that has always been there for as long as I can remember and will now continue to be there, albeit in a different way.</p>

<p><em>Tears in Heaven</em> is a tune with grief at its core: Clapton’s tragic memorial of his son gone too soon after tumbling through a window at the tender age of four. The forlorn longing in his voice is palpable when he pleadingly asks if his deceased boy would know his name should they meet in heaven. I’m not sure things like that matter to me now—I have known and will remember her name in this life and I am better for it.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Self/Less</em>—Alecia Creti</h3>

<p>I featured a track from Gallant in <a href="/blog/2025/02/19/7-songs-feb-2025">last month’s 7 Songs</a> and mentioned I’d had a chance to watch him perform live for the first time in a while at the Independent in San Francisco. Alecia Creti opened for him at that show and it was wonderful to get acquainted with her music alongside her detailed narratives about each number on her setlist. Her vocal performance was astounding and her simultaneous piano accompaniment intimate and moving.</p>

<p>Despite occasionally surfacing twinges of emotional immaturity, her interstitial monologues painted an authentic and endearing portrait of a young artist in the midst of experiencing their dreams come to fruition and developing a stronger sense of self that manifests powerfully in their craft. <em>Self/Less</em> is a track about having the courage and strength to put oneself first when doing so seems to run counter to duty to others (namely family). That theme resonated with me powerfully as I stood in the audience while Alecia belted the words.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>magnetic</em>—UMI</h3>

<p>I remember a lot about the first time I heard <em>Forest in the City</em> years ago. It was a very fitting record to sulk to as I left the place I call home in a sense more final than ever before—my love for someone receding; unmaintanable in the face of timing, circumstance, and the different ways life tends to work out for different people. <em>magnetic</em> potently highlights that contrast between yearning and realism: love, however broad and deep, isn’t always sufficient to ensure its own preservation.</p>

<p>While once a deeply sad listen, the shape of melancholy it brings forth is different now. It’s about having had the privilege to love, gaining the wisdom to know that sharing a life with someone is about more than feelings, and growing enough to let go of being drawn to someone when that needs to happen to make room for more life.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>On a Mountain Under Full Moon</em>—Wicca Phase Springs Eternal feat. Fantasy Camp</h3>

<p>Adam McIlwee sings like a boy with a sometimes magical and other times painful, yet always rich inner world who’s frequently catching himself in the middle of urban or rural nowhere, wistfully appreciating the mysteries of the universe… and I <em>get</em> that. The importance of regarding the moon—full or otherwise—should not be discounted, whether on a mountain or on the range. The outro’s acoustic guitar harmonics with time-stretched reverse delay are a great example of doing a lot with a little. Gestures like that inspire novel approaches to my own arrangements.</p>

<p>More on letting go as a lyrical theme in this one, much of it from the Fantasy Camp feature:</p>

<p><em>It’s the mystery I’m after</em><br />
<em>It’s the magic I believe in</em><br />
<em>On a mountain under full moon</em><br />
<em>I can say goodnight and mean it</em></p>

<p><em>But if you ever really loved me</em><br />
<em>You would say goodnight and set me free</em></p>

<p><em>So don’t you worry ‘bout me</em><br />
<em>I kinda like this feeling</em><br />
<em>I’m the master of my own world</em><br />
<em>Riding into the evening</em></p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Heaven Will Come</em>—Tim Hecker</h3>

<p>Tim Hecker’s sonic landscaping feels inextricably focused on evoking the divine, giving equal attention to both its heavenly and haunting auras. If there ever were an assurance that heaven will come, it can be found in reverberating organ progressions textured and modulated with the signatures of careful Max patchwork.</p>

<p>It’s another great soundtrack for momentary nowheres—time between events, space between places that become holy sites unto themselves in newfound ways. Appreciating ambient music conditions an appreciation of being with spaciousness. In Hecker’s work, that spaciousness is a divine void that shifts between light and dark, warm and cool, this world and another. Perhaps here, it can be a shift between the darker sides of grief and the room for something newer and brighter that lies beyond.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>A Greater Love</em>—Yves Tumor</h3>

<p><em>A Greater Love</em> is the moody and ethereal conclusion to 2020’s <em>Heaven To A Tortured Mind</em>. It’s a song about change: the change in the seasons, the weather, and the emotions and connections that shift as time has its way with all of us. The power of loss to change us for the better—to beneficially reshape our relationships with others and with ourselves—is an under-acknowledged silver lining of grief.</p>

<iframe class="mt-50" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3u3kKwR4TgxtPxJFvVWn7F?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>道 (Michi)</em>—Hikaru Utada</h3>

<p>Human beings, narratively obsessed as we are, tend to hope that the culmination of grieving heralds a return to normalcy and perhaps even greener pastures beyond: a road to thriving in greater wholeness. Utada’s <em>道 (Michi)</em>—<em>road</em> in English—draws the contours of that road. It’s the opening track on 2016’s <em>Fantôme</em>: a return from a lengthy hiatus, and a record that Utada takes particular pride in: “[<em>Fantôme</em>] marked the beginning of a new chapter of my life as an artist and as a human being.”</p>

<p>The track and the album as a whole surfaced meditations on loss and grief in the wake of the artist’s mother’s tragic suicide. The chorus offers an enduring reminder that we can be lonely, yet not alone; that life can be grieved but also celebrated and that it can give birth to new life, much like Utada’s career beginnings were inspired by her mother’s musicianship.</p>

<p>It is in 2024’s <em>Science Fiction</em> compilation album that <em>Michi</em> finds new life of its own, still an upbeat and danceable standout even amidst collaborations with A.G. Cook and Floating Points. It was seemingly a happier time for Utada, marking the 25th anniversary of her debut while she raises a child of her own (also featured on the album). I think that’s how I’d like to end this month’s list: with an upbeat and hopeful reflection on what’s possible after grief subsides.</p>

<p>A friend put me onto this track back in November after hearing my guitar noodling reminded him of the intro loop and it hasn’t left my rotation for long since. Jon Bellion’s triumphant return with a first solo track in six years is equal parts melodic and aggressive, with a driving energy that reminds me what it’s like to keep trying to get back to the feeling of being a kid again, cooking things up in my bedroom.</p>

<iframe class="mt-50" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0FcVZWtHJ0XoHhbT8fiyAg?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Red Synthetic</em>—Zhone</h3>

<p>My second pick of the month isn’t a new track, but I come back to Zhone’s <em>Red Synthetic</em> frequently. Sonically, there’s a ton to appreciate about it: huge, cinematic dynamics and sound design and that moment just past the halfway mark where the filter EQ sweeps down on the vocal refrain to yield something like a vocoder synth. This track’s release notably calls forth the spirit of this post series: music discovery through the lens of first-person experience. There’s something special about the way online music discovery in particular evolved over the decade leading up to this release in 2021. I used to usually discover music online through the blogosphere, but by the height of the pandemic, I found myself in niche online communities communicating and collaborating with artists, sharing work in its early stages.</p>

<p>I first heard this track when Zhone shared a pre-release version in Outskrrts, an online community that broke out of <a href="twitch.tv/yungskrrt">Yung Skrrt’s Twitch stream</a> during the pandemic to organize events like stream pregames, afterparty raves, and artist showcases, all over Zoom. The release later found a home on Vol. 4 (<em>LOVE</em>) of the <em>Mutants</em> Mixtape series of benefit compilations, themselves a product of a niche online community of artists: the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/RnSWscwmaw">Mutants1000000 Discord</a> launched by Arca right as the world went into lockdown in March of 2020. I cherish the special connections that are still in my life from my time in these communities and hold sacred the opportunity to observe artists’ nascent work as they share stories behind it.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Blue Hour</em>—Nosaj Thing feat. Julianna Barwick</h3>

<p>A couple of months ago, I caught a special performance featuring Nosaj Thing at the Audrey Irmas Pavilion in Koreatown. The venue itself is a marvel—geometric and imposing, yet somehow inviting, like a monument to the modern. The night was a layered experience: an exhibition upstairs featuring art and technology experiments, followed by <a href="https://www.kevinpeterhe.com/flux"><em>Flux,</em></a> a collaboration between Kevin Peter He and Jake Oleson that blended live music with real-time 3D cinematics and dynamic camera work. It was a fluid, maximalist vision of what’s possible at the intersection of sound and image.</p>

<p>Afterward, Nosaj Thing took the stage, framed by simple film projections—subtle, restrained, evocative. After the hypermodern spectacle of <em>Flux,</em> his set felt like a meditation, pulling attention toward nostalgia rather than novelty. <em>Blue Hour</em> in particular hit me in that way—like something slipping through my fingers, a fleeting warmth held just long enough to feel its absence. The visuals accompanying it had a liminal, in-between quality—scenes that could be anywhere and nowhere, the kind of images that bring to mind times caught in the cracks of a city, existing but untethered, anonymous in the early hours of the morning.</p>

<p>Watching Nosaj Thing in LA again some 15 years after first seeing him perform at Low End Theory was a full-circle moment. That era still lingers in my head like a half-remembered dream… and that’s exactly what the city looked like as I stepped outside into the rainy night to find some casein.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Curves</em>—Ivy Lab</h3>

<p><em>Curves</em> by Ivy Lab also feels like a transmission from the late aughts LA Beat Scene: Low End Theory, Shlohmo, the WEDIDIT crew, etc. The track vibes in a lush space between ambient ethereality and club weight, where textures stretch and morph into something atmospheric and trip-hop sensibilities meet sculpted bass design. This sound isn’t terribly new anymore, but here it seems to remain pure as a hypnotic loop bending time around its pulses. It’s a solid reminder of similar sounds from the past, still echoing and resonating.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Fellow Traveler</em>—Fucked Up</h3>

<p><em>Fellow Traveler</em> kicks off with a reversing tape loop that winds back time just before the a wildly distorted riff tears through the mix. The call-and-response vocals layer in tasteful harmonies that offer a kind of rough singsong quality. It’s a song with driving force that never stops moving, bursting with a restless, youthful energy that makes me want to run outside and keep running until the last note fades.</p>

<iframe class="mt-50" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6OGg4W6YQ0VO7SOvWvYLV8?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Subversion (Brand New Love)</em>—Touché Amoré feat. Lou Barlow</h3>

<p>The guys in Touché are approaching (if not already within) their middle age years (frontman Jeremy Bolm now boasts 41 years of age). That’s a sobering realization. I’m not quite there yet myself, but it’s been more than half my lifetime since I started watching them play small rooms in LA and I won’t lie, I’m starting to feel the clock. What better opportunity to interpolate Sebadoh’s <em>Brand New Love</em>—a song about cautious hope and openness to something new (<em>anyone could be a brand new love</em>)—alongside original lyricist Lou Barlow. Bolm’s refrain says it best:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I can’t see</em><br />
<em>Beyond the</em><br />
<em>Years behind me</em><br />
<em>And it’s staggering</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Bourbon</em>—Gallant</h3>

<p>Earlier this month, I had the chance to see Gallant perform at the Independent in San Francisco on tour for his latest release <em>Zinc</em>. His always stellar performance made for a fun show where I ran into old friends and made some new ones. Some fans I chatted with expressed a lingering preference for his debut album, <em>Ology</em> (2016), over the newer material (a sentiment I share). While I hope that the soaring falsettos and anthemic delivery on <em>Bourbon</em> gave those fans what they were looking for, I found a lot of appreciation for how the live band instrumentation added dimension to Gallant’s newer material. It was a good reminder that making room for what’s new sometimes means loosening one’s hold on the past—<em>trust the detox.</em></p>

<h2 id="diy">Generate your own insights</h2>

<p>Generate insights for any artist of your choice from your own Spotify streaming data. Here’s how:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Visit the Spotify Account privacy page and log in</li>
  <li>Request a copy of your personal data with the Download your data tool
    <ul>
      <li>Use the normal option, not <em>Extended streaming history</em></li>
      <li>It will take some time for Spotify to process your data and email you back with a download link</li>
      <li>Download and unarchive your data</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Download code from <a href="https://gist.github.com/stedmanhalliday/910dbf4fe1193d2849966fe28bbc56c6">this gist</a>, or copy it to a new file from the block below</li>
  <li>Place the script file in the same directory as the unarchived data folder (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Spotify Account Data</code>)</li>
  <li>Edit the constants up top for the artist and number of top tracks you’d like to output</li>
  <li>Run the script from the command line with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a> or an equivalent JavaScript runtime environment</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Bonus: use <a href="https://carbon.now.sh/">Carbon</a> to generate cool snapshots of your stats like the ones I’ve featured in this post</li>
</ul>
