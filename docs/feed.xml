There is something (several specific things, actually) about his music that triggers a deep fixation in me with roots as low as the limbic tier. I’ll write a blog post about them someday in honor of the Gimbus GOAT King of Internet Music.</p>

<p>For now, I’ll collate annual analytics for my Yung Skrrt streaming data which I’ve been collecting for four years running. I’ll also share <a href="#diy">my code</a> so you can generate insights from your own Spotify streaming data for your favorite artists.</p>

<h2 id="diy">Generate your own insights</h2>

<p>Generate insights for any artist of your choice from your own Spotify streaming data. Here’s how:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Visit the Spotify Account privacy page and log in</li>
  <li>Request a copy of your personal data with the Download your data tool
    <ul>
      <li>Use the normal option, not <em>Extended streaming history</em></li>
      <li>It will take some time for Spotify to process your data and email you back with a download link</li>
      <li>Download and unarchive your data</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Download code from <a href="https://gist.github.com/stedmanhalliday/910dbf4fe1193d2849966fe28bbc56c6">this gist</a>, or copy it to a new file from the block below</li>
  <li>Place the script file in the same directory as the unarchived data folder (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Spotify Account Data</code>)</li>
  <li>Edit the constants up top for the artist and number of top tracks you’d like to output</li>
  <li>Run the script from the command line with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a> or an equivalent JavaScript runtime environment</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Bonus: use <a href="https://carbon.now.sh/">Carbon</a> to generate cool snapshots of your stats like the ones I’ve featured in this post</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Stand just once at the stage where the stone by the road means as much to you as Goethe and Tolstoy, you will thereafter gain from Goethe, Tolstoy, and all poets infinitely more value, more sap and honey, more affirmation of life and of yourself than ever before.</em></p>

  <p><em>For the works of Goethe are not Goethe and the volumes of Dostoevsky are not Dostoevsky, they are only an attempt, a dubious and never successful attempt, to conjure up the many-voiced multitudinous world of which he was the central point.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>When an archer is shooting for nothing he has all his skill. If he shoots for a brass buckle he is already nervous. If he shoots for a prize of gold he goes blind or sees two targets—he is out of his mind. His skill has not changed, but the prize divides him. He cares, he thinks more of winning than of shooting—and the need to win drains him of power.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>One who seeks friendship for favorable occasions strips it of all its nobility.</em></p>

  <p><em>If you consider any man a friend whom you do not trust as you trust yourself, you are mightily mistaken and you do not sufficiently understand what true friendship means… When friendship is settled, you must trust; before friendship is formed, you must pass judgment. Those persons indeed put last first and confound their duties, who… judge a man after they have made him their friend, instead of making him their friend after they have judged him. Ponder for a long time whether you shall admit a given person to your friendship; but when you have decided to admit him, welcome him with all your heart and soul. Speak as boldly with him as with yourself… Regard him as loyal and you will make him loyal.</em></p>

<p>I’ve spent much of autumn’s turn to winter coasting around California in a sedan. I’m surprised at how long it’s taken me to give the roads their fair due with amount of time I’ve lived in California while owning a car. When Mount Eerie’s been on, I’ve found myself stopping more frequently to contemplate whatever’s knocking at the threshold of my attention—a scenic vista or a mundane slice of time. Awareness has taken on a wide range of flavors from slow and viscous to bold, sweeping, and dynamic. It’s an appropriate soundtrack for being present nowhere in particular.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Circles</em>—Thrice</h3>
<p>There’s something I truly appreciate about the way many gems from Thrice’s wide-ranging discography allow themselves <a href="https://x.com/stedmanhalliday/status/1879417785857761549">to be found</a> and sat within time and again. <em>Beggars</em> is one of my favorite records and <em>Circles</em> is a highlight that’s equal parts somber and expansive, with a small measure of twinkling hope. The lyrics characterize humans as intrepid yet futile in our perennial quests to cast ourselves into the dark and build upon what we know despite our ultimate ignorance, blindness, and fallibility. I haven’t watched these guys play in over 10 years (since the last dates of their farewell tour pre-reunion); perhaps it’s time to indulge a little nostalgia.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Hey Listen</em>—Drug Church</h3>
<p>Drug Church’s <em>Prude</em> was one of my favorite releases of 2024. It doesn’t break much new ground sonically, but the songs are well written despite their structural and lyrical simplicity. The tracklist is built with vignettes—often crushing ones—of life on the other side of cracks in modern life that many people would rather just pretend aren’t there (along with the people who’ve fallen through them). Hearing <em>Hey Listen</em> reminds me of an unlucky kid I used to get into trouble with when I was running low on luck myself. It makes me feel abruptly anxious and awfully guilty; sapped and resigned to abject cowardice, shame, and disappointment, yet ultimately grateful. It is indeed tough to find an upside, but there’s no hope for luck without the intent to search. Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/em32label/status/1885020104917954783">Carlos Jarquin</a> for listening to me yap about sad shit. <a href="https://forms.gle/Dt7X7wBvobb9cPdC7">Go tell him</a> about a song that means something to you.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Hollywood</em>—Toro y Moi, Benjamin Gibbard</h3>
<p>The end of last year saw me falling back into old patterns of landing myself in some total bullshit in Hollywood. Changing—truly and permanently changing—is a tall order. I guess I’m working my way up to it, but it’s really nobody’s business to even try to help me with this stuff anymore. On an entirely separate note, instrumental production is resonating with me here as creative inspiration. I’m sitting on several years’ worth of 8-bar guitar loops that need arrangements to call a home and I had a fun time bringing some field recordings of indigenous chants and my gamelan percussion fiddlings over to a local session with <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hexani">hex_</a> earlier this month. <em>I need to finish things!</em></p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>HEAL</em>—Machinedrum, AKTHESAVIOR, Deniro Farrar</h3>
<p>Machinedrum’s curatorial efforts on the compilation mentioned above came fresh off the heels of a deluxe LP release. <em>3FOR82_D3LUX3</em> brings even more solid cuts to the table than the original release from back in the spring and this track found me again at the right time in life to embed itself deeply in my rotation. It’s been over 10 years since the <em>Vapor City</em> era and somehow this guy is still finding new things to execute very well. I enjoy the range of experimentation in his crossovers into black music. Not everything hits for me—e.g. I don’t <em>dislike</em> the Jesse Boykins III collaborations, but it’s easy to find R&amp;B I’m more fond of. <em>Kane Train</em> with Freddy Gibbs (2020) was a smash by comparison; a definitive step up in Machinedrum’s ability to find a pocket in hip-hop production with vocal features. <em>HEAL</em> (2024) takes that deeper than production and performance into the realm of transcendent emotional appeal. It’s perhaps a tad less instrumentally inventive but still exquisitely arranged, sitting behind the vocal where it needs to yet still placing melodic variation and dynamic highs where they fit best. Stellar and moving vocal performance and message: life is hard… find a way to push through.</p>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Lullaby</em>—TURQUOISEDEATH</h3>
<p>I’ve been riding around at night a lot with TURQUOISEDEATH. I’d comfortably put <em>Kaleidoscope</em> in the 2024 sleepers category; definitely unexpected replay value. Solid balance of ethereal ambiance, danceable tempos, and pedal to the metal breakbeat-filled DnB/jungle-esque goodness—not terribly novel, but thoroughly enjoyable.</p>

<p class="mt-200">Ever wished you could hack your sleep schedule, beat jetlag, or stay sharp through an all-nighter without feeling like a zombie? Enter propranolol—a seemingly ordinary beta blocker with some extraordinary tricks up its sleeve. From calming anxiety to resetting your internal clock, propranolol might just be the secret weapon you've been looking for to take control of your sleep and energy levels.</p>

<div class="mv-200 divider-thin"></div>

<h2 id="overview-of-beta-blockers">Overview of beta blockers</h2>

<h3 id="mechanism-of-action">Mechanism of action</h3>

<p>Beta blockers generally inhibit signals from the sympathetic nervous system, leading to reduced anxiety levels by limiting the heart’s ability to respond to stress.</p>

<p>Beta blockers generally inhibit signals from the sympathetic nervous system, leading to reduced anxiety levels by limiting the heart’s ability to respond to stress.</p>

<h3 id="beta-blocker-subtypes">Beta blocker subtypes</h3>

<p>Cardioselective beta blockers mainly work on the heart by blocking beta-1 receptors, which helps lower heart rate and blood pressure. Because they focus more on the heart, they don’t affect the lungs as much, making them safer for people with breathing problems like asthma or COPD.</p>

<p>Non-selective beta blockers block both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. Since beta-2 receptors are found in the lungs, blood vessels, and muscles, these drugs can affect more than just the heart. This can cause side effects like tightening of the airways, making them less safe for people with asthma or COPD.</p>

<h3 id="applications-for-anxiety">Applications for Anxiety</h3>

<p>This mechanism is particularly beneficial for individuals with social anxiety or general anxiety disorders, as it mitigates physical symptoms of anxiety.</p>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h2 id="propranolol-specifics">Propranolol specifics</h2>

<p>Propranolol is a non-selective beta blocker. It is the most lipophilic (fat-soluble) among them, which enables it to cross the blood-brain barrier more effectively.</p>

<h3 id="effects-on-circadian-rhythm">Effects on circadian rhythm</h3>

<p>When propranolol crosses into the brain, it affects the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in a way that mimics morning blue light exposure. This can lower the body’s natural production of melatonin, which might lead to insomnia and nightmares.</p>

<h3 id="application">Application</h3>

<p>Propranolol can be used to intentionally reduce melatonin production, making it easier to stay awake longer, such as when pulling an all-nighter. It can also be used to reset a chronically desynchronized sleep schedule or overcome jetlag.</p>

<h2 id="example-reversing-a-nocturnal-routine">Example: reversing a nocturnal routine</h2>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>Drue Wetsel, a 25-year-old software engineer, has been stuck in a nocturnal routine, habitually falling asleep at 5 am and waking up around 1 pm. He wants to reset his sleep schedule to fall asleep at midnight and wake up at 8 am to align better with a more typical workday and improve his overall health.</p>

<h3 id="circadian-reset-protocol">Circadian reset protocol</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>5 am:</strong> Drue goes to bed at his usual time and sets an alarm for 8 am, planning to get only 3 hours of sleep.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>8 am:</strong> He wakes up, takes propranolol, and uses caffeine to power through the day on minimal sleep.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>12 pm – 6 pm:</strong> Drue keeps himself busy and alert, using a brief NSDR (non-sleep deep rest) session to avoid napping and maintain energy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>12 am:</strong> Exhausted, Drue finally goes to bed at his new target bedtime, setting an alarm for 8 am to reinforce the new schedule.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Following days:</strong> Drue sticks to the midnight-to-8 am sleep schedule, using propranolol and mild stimulants as needed, until it becomes his new norm.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h2 id="additional-medical-applications">Additional medical applications</h2>

<p><strong>Thyroid storm management:</strong> Propranolol helps manage dangerously fast heart rate and high blood pressure caused by excessive thyroid hormone by slowing down the heart and easing other symptoms like anxiety and tremors.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention of cardiac remodeling:</strong> propranolol can help prevent changes in heart structure caused by heart failure (however, other beta blockers are more commonly used for this purpose).</p>

<p><strong>Prophylactic use in cirrhotics:</strong> variceal bleeding occurs when swollen veins in the esophagus or stomach burst and bleed due to liver disease. Non-selective beta blockers like propranolol help prevent this by reducing pressure in those veins.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment of essential tremors:</strong> essential tremors cause uncontrollable shaking, often in the hands. Propranolol helps reduce this shaking, making it easier for people to do everyday tasks.</p>

<h2 id="cautions-and-side-effects">Cautions and side effects</h2>

<p><strong>Respiratory concerns:</strong> propranolol and other non-selective beta blockers can exacerbate asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, propranolol is a versatile non-selective beta blocker with a range of applications, from managing anxiety and essential tremors to preventing serious complications in conditions like thyroid storm and cirrhosis. Its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier makes it particularly effective for altering circadian rhythms, offering a solution for those needing to reset their sleep schedules. However, caution is necessary, especially for individuals with respiratory conditions, as propranolol can exacerbate issues like asthma and COPD. Consult a healthcare professional for guidance before using propranolol.</p>

<p>Sharon Steed kicked off the event mincing no words about one of the defining struggles of her life: she has a speech impediment. Steed spoke about how her experience inspired her to become a <a href="http://communilogue.co/">consultant</a> who advocates for more empathy in business for the benefit of leaders, workers, businesses, and consumers. Below are some key insights from her talk.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Empathy defines an organization’s culture (shared values, attitudes, standards, and beliefs) which underlies the intent of a design system; who and what companies care about shows through.</li>
  <li>Work is a big part of love, and love should be a big part of work. Love can be an abstract idea (noun) but in many contexts it connotes a set of small choices we make to consider one another every day in our communication.</li>
  <li>Practical tactics for increasing workplace empathy:
    <ol>
      <li>develop patience</li>
      <li>cultivate perspective; rephrase your intent, focus on understanding, and persist in seeking consensus</li>
      <li>form connections by speaking with clear intent</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kimwms_">Kim Williams</a> got everyone on the same page with a case study of her team’s work on Indeed’s design system. Some insights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s better to have a hundred people who love your product than a million who like it. Starting there can pay dividends.</li>
  <li>Design systems are so great because they’re a documented and realized instantiation of so many practice areas that intersect to allow customer centricity: brand identity systems, content strategy, design engineering, discovery and insights, research, design ops, product design, etc.</li>
  <li>Across different domains of organizational praxis, innovation emerges from the summative constraints of what’s desirable, feasible, and viable.</li>
</ul>

</figure>

<p>Yesenia Perez-Cruz talked about increasing the efficacy of a design system by intelligently utilizing context as a constraint that shapes its focus and intent. She moved through a <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/yeseniaperezcruz/building-flexible-design-systems">case study</a> of how <a href="https://www.vox.com/">Vox</a> pursued a design system that balances the needs of multiple brands and web properties. Key points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t start with components—they need context and purpose. Start with language because it shapes content and addresses people. Starting there helps orient systems around semantic differences rather than presentational ones.</li>
  <li>All patterns should solve specific problems rather than aiming to create a one-size-fits-all solution. Avoid developing patterns for hypothetical situations.</li>
  <li>In writings on his “atomic design” philosophy, Brad Frost has explicated the UI inventory process from a visual/presentational angle. Perez-Cruz contends that this should be followed by a purpose-driven inventory that identifies the common semantic contexts of UI components.</li>

<p>Adekunle Oduye’s talk focused on the philosophically important details of technical implementation that are key to the cross-functional benefits of a successful design system.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design systems are for <em>people!</em> Successful design systems that are heavily and effectively utilized across an organization properly balance the needs of their producers and consumers.</li>
  <li><em>Process</em> is paramount in the development of a design system in order to align outcomes with goals. It defines how the system compromises with constraints to navigate diverse needs.</li>
  <li><em>Prototyping</em> is a must! “It’s not real until it’s in the code.”

<ul>
  <li>Hom made a case for more thorough efforts in illustrative diversity. She exposed strategies for cultivating deeper interest in others’ experiences and translating them into expressive visual language for a design system.</li>
  <li>She drove home the incredible importance of custom in-house work for high-performing illustration in design systems.</li>
  <li>She didn’t have a committal answer when asked what the best alternative to in-house work was; it is that invaluable. Sometimes, you just need custom work.</li>

<p>I was feeling pretty jetlagged so I slept in a bit and missed this first talk of the morning by Hamish Smyth and Jesse Reed. I’m awaiting the recap.</p>

<p>Amélie Lamont’s talk made some fascinating connections between design systems and language through the lens of poetry. All the snaps for this one 🫰!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design systems start with language and we should recognize that words have power.</li>
  <li>Language is not neutral or apolitical and employing it usefully requires institutional knowledge and consent from individuals with skin in the game.</li>
  <li>The loudest voices will always be heard, but will they be listened to?</li>
  <li>Gatekeeping sucks!</li>
</ul>

<p>Dan Mall’s talk was <em>FUN!</em> He gave out Dum Dums lollipops for design systems jeopardy 😊🍭. The talk was a compelling look at what design systems can actually do for designers and why we shouldn’t be afraid to push them forward in product-oriented organizations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design systems are probably most heavily utilized by… developers. Designers understandably fear automation and it informs our behind-the-scenes relationship with design systems. But there are silver linings!</li>
  <li>We should be discerning about the things we build into design systems to maximize their utility and ability to scale design at quality within an organization.</li>
  <li>What makes a museum special is what’s not on the walls (a building with everything is just a warehouse).</li>
  <li>Design systems should work on the 80/20 principle: they can be used to reduce design effort on the bulk of repeatable tasks so that designers can focus on high-impact work that requires more nuanced attention to detail. This is the unscalable stuff; the stuff there’s usually no time or budget for, but that can synthesize great design moments.</li>
</ul>

<p>Michelle Alvarez and Yasmine Evjen discussed Google’s ongoing efforts to extend Material Design’s philosophy. They’re working on theming tools to allow designers more flexibility in brand expression within one of the most widely adopted design systems. You can see some of the fruits of their labor on <a href="https://material.io/design/material-studies/">Material Design’s website.</a></p>

<figcaption>Sketch notes by <a href="https://www.clarityconf.com/people/natalya-shelburne">Natalya Shelburne</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Julie Ann Horvath talked about deftly navigating the process of creating institutional partnerships within organizations to internally evangelize design systems and maximize their efficacy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When considering a design system as a solution and stating its value to stakeholders designers should begin by gathering data to quantify the value proposition of investing in a systems undertaking.</li>
  <li>“Us vs. them” thinking must disappear; good design systems incorporate the needs of diverse producers and consumers both within and outside of an organization. Strategic partnerships are necessary for success and that requires compromise and negotiation.</li>
  <li>Orgs should invest heavily in the build process and treat delivery as a service or product to be designed. Components don’t create value until live in a production environment.</li>
</ul>

</figure>

<p>John Maeda followed up on Horvath’s momentum with a personal, humorous, and inspiringly philosophical take on where we are with design systems as 2018 comes to a close.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We’ve reached the stage of negotiating fluency in thinking about and creating design systems (it happened with stylesheets, responsive design, and many other technology paradigms before).</li>
  <li>Design systems are a wonderful tool for enforcing organizational collaboration and finally killing <a href="https://stedmanhalliday.com/blog/2017/11/22/toxic-design-community">auteur theory in design.</a> I’ll let you wait for the recap to hear the rest!</li>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Clarity was a blast! On top of all the great talks mentioned in this summary, there were workshops, happy hours with lightning talks, tech demos, and an after-party with a sweet view on the top floor of the New Museum (check out the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/clarityconf/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=2250831095129369">photo album</a>). A very special thanks to Jina and all of the other organizers, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers for pouring a bunch of love into organizing an event where so many amazing voices could be heard. Thanks to Figma and Katie Gregorio as well for selecting me for the conference scholarship!</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>I’m a community manager at <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/designguild">Designers Guild</a> where we just completed a pilot run of Facebook’s new Mentorship feature (currently being tested in Groups and Pages). As part of our trial—along with setting up some organizational resources and gathering feedback—I participated in our 8-week, 6-step program as a mentee with a small cohort of other members who applied for the program.</p>

<p>Brad Monahan also moderates Designers Guild and agreed to help out by participating in the program as my mentor. Serendipitously, Brad is also a design manager at Uber and providing direction for designers’ career growth is a core function of his role there. Something that Brad and I began discussing early on is the kind of environment I’d like to work in for the next phase of my design career.</p>

<p>One thing that piqued my interest was the particular way in which Brad described his own job. He doesn’t see moving into management so much as ceasing to design but instead described it as designing different things (teams) to achieve impact in different ways. He unraveled this thread a bit for me and introduced me to a book called <em>Org Design for Design Orgs</em> and the emerging field of design operations (aka <em>design ops</em>). I ended up watching a couple of talks by the authors and annotating them for homework that week.</p>

<h2 id="org-design-notes-from-peter-merholz">Org Design Notes from Peter Merholz</h2>

<h3 id="org-designs-general-philosophy">Org Design’s General Philosophy</h3>

<p>Merholz contends that service design is the best lens to peer through in order to understand the core philosophy underlying org design.</p>

<blockquote class="bigquote">
All design is service design.
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Many customer touch points occur throughout a <em>journey</em>.</li>
  <li>Design can inform and drive a diverse set of business processes such as management, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, sales, and support.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="organizational-models-for-design-teams">Organizational Models for Design Teams</h3>

<p>Organizational models for design teams can vary quite a bit. Merholz splits these into 3 major categories.</p>

<h4 id="centralized-internal-services">Centralized Internal Services</h4>

<p><em>An in-house agency</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>This model is project-based.</li>
  <li>Teams are organized by function.</li>
  <li>Designers are farmed out on projects as needed.</li>
</ul>

<figure>
<img alt="centralized internal services pros and cons" src="/assets/img/2018-11-30-table-0.webp" />
<figcaption>Common pros and cons of the centralized internal services model</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4 id="decentralized--embedded">Decentralized &amp; Embedded</h4>

<p><em>Everyone gets a designer; pods in squads</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>This model is program-based.</li>
  <li>Designers are embedded as core team members.</li>
  <li>It’s common for this model to create teams with 1, 2, or few designer(s).</li>
</ul>

<figure>
<img alt="decentralized and embedded pros and cons" src="/assets/img/2018-11-30-table-1.webp" />
<figcaption>Common pros and cons of the decentralized and embedded model</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4 id="centralized-partnership">Centralized Partnership</h4>

<p><em>The best of both worlds</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Senior designers maintain connections to specialized org teams, while not necessarily embedded (i.e. decentralized and embedded model).</li>
  <li>This makes sense since designers will possess deeper vertical skillsets later in their careers.</li>
  <li>Less experienced designers become more modular gears, slotting into project functions as needed (i.e. centralized model).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>It’s clear that Merholz favors compromise when it comes to the structure of design organizations.</strong> He identifies numerous advantages to hybridity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Designers feel supported in their careers, skill development, and daily workplace needs.</li>
  <li>Design teams maintain commitment to products and features.</li>
  <li>Centralization helps maintain a holistic view across the entire customer journey and different segments of the organization.</li>
  <li>Junior designers have mobility after shorter commitments.</li>
  <li>Teams are organized by steps in the customer journey which prevents frequent team reorganization.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-12-qualities-of-effective-design-orgs">The 12 Qualities of Effective Design Orgs</h3>

<p>Skinner identifies three categories of useful qualities in design orgs.</p>

<h4 id="foundation">Foundation</h4>

<p>1. Shared sense of purpose</p>

<p>2. Focused, empowered leadership</p>

<p>3. Authentic user empathy</p>

<p>4. Understand, articulate, and create value</p>

<h4 id="output">Output</h4>

<p>5. Support the entire journey</p>

<p>6. Delivers at all levels of scale</p>

<p>7. Establish and uphold standards of quality</p>

<p>8. Value delivery over perfection</p>

<h4 id="management">Management</h4>

<p>9. Treat team members as people, not resources</p>

<p>10. Diversity of perspective and background</p>

<p>11. Foster a collaborative environment</p>

<p>12. Manage operations effectively</p>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h3 id="decision-making">Decision Making</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Half the decisions in organizations fail.</em></p>

  <p>—Paul Nutt, Author and Professor, Ohio State University</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Fragmented decision making can have an outsized impact.</strong></p>

<p>Here are some study results on the number of viable solutions to business problems generated from different decision-making processes (ranked):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identifying performance gaps</li>
  <li>Goal setting</li>
  <li>Problem solving</li>
  <li>Leader makes decisions</li>
</ol>

<p>More inclusive and participatory management styles yield more solutions.</p>

  <li>A maker at this stage</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="product-designer">Product Designer</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Focuses on structure and surface of design solutions</li>
  <li>Examples: interaction design, visual design, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="mt-200">Stage 2: Full Team</h4>

<ul>
  <li>This stage may add more product designers.</li>
  <li>The team now consists of 5–7 people.</li>
  <li>Specialized hires are brought on (not limited to the examples below):</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="content-strategist">Content Strategist</h5>

<p>Responsible for <strong>voice and tone</strong>, content structure, and copywriting</p>

<h5 id="communication-designer">Communication Designer</h5>

<p><strong>Owns visual design through multiple channels:</strong> online and offline, brand applications, information design, etc.</p>

<h4 class="mt-200">Stage 3: Design Org</h4>

<p>The org now comprises at least 20 people. More examples of additions follow:</p>

<h5 id="team-lead">Team Lead</h5>

<p>A <strong>people manager</strong> type with <strong>domain expertise</strong> who’s <strong>still practicing</strong></p>

<h5 id="ux-researcher">UX Researcher</h5>

<p>This is a <strong>generative and evaluative</strong> role that is ideally <strong>highly leveraged throughout the org.</strong></p>

<h5 id="head-of-design-revisited">Head of Design (revisited)</h5>

<p>At this stage it’s common for HoD’s to struggle with scale and cede the role to directors with more experience.</p>

<h4 class="mt-200">Stage 4: Coordinated Org</h4>

<p>This stage is primarily focused on managing scale-related complexity.</p>

<h5 id="service-designer">Service Designer</h5>

<p>These designers integrate strategy and structure across teams.</p>

<p>This manager focuses on <strong>practice, communication, and prioritization,</strong> working towards an overall objective of <strong>organizational effectiveness.</strong></p>

<h4 class="mt-200">Stage 5: Distributed Leadership</h4>

<p>This is the final growth taxonomy of design organizations in Skinner’s model.</p>

<h5 id="design-director">Design Director</h5>

<p>This leader oversees a swath of <strong>experiences across teams.</strong></p>

<h5 id="creative-director">Creative Director</h5>

<p>This leader establishes <strong>quality standards</strong> via <strong>creative leadership.</strong></p>

  <li>difficulty with cross-functional collaboration within the entire org</li>
  <li>unsuitable project or program staffing</li>
  <li>poor visibility into related work streams</li>
  <li>duplicated efforts across teams</li>
  <li>non-existent measurement infrastructure</li>

<p>In case you haven’t heard, MailChimp is now Mailchimp. That’s right, it’s #rebrand season! Get an overview of what’s new on <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90241616/see-mailchimps-weird-new-branding"><em>Fast Company</em></a> and dive in a little deeper at <a href="https://mailchimp.com/design/">Mailchimp Design</a>.</p>

<p><em>This article was inspired by a thread in <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/designguild">Designers Guild</a>, a Facebook community that I help moderate. Designers Guild consists of 10,000+ designers committed to discussing, learning, and growing together. Jon Bell (Senior Design Manager at Mailchimp) unveiled the company’s fresh rebrand (with support from Collins and R/GA) and asked the community for its thoughts. After digging into the work a little and sleeping on it yesterday, I had the opportunity to prepare some more fleshed out opinions this morning (prompted by Jenny Earnest).</em></p>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h2 id="freddie-forever">Freddie Forever!</h2>

<p>It’s nice when a rebrand can preserve the iconic elements of a company’s history, so I like that Mailchimp kept Freddie as a logo. The lockups with the new wordmark also look fantastic; they preserve the lighthearted quality of the old script logotype, but find harmony with Freddie’s weightier aesthetic. The team nailed the logo portion of this rebrand.</p>

<figure>
<img alt="Mailchimp animation" src="/assets/img/2018-09-27-mailchimp-animation.gif" />
<figcaption>Mailchimp’s new logo lockup (now with 🔥 inktraps)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I enjoy how the other design elements (such as typography and illustration) coalesce and the Cavendish swatch dignifies everything pretty nicely. The aesthetic gestures are very appreciable on the surface, but after some more consideration, I’m not 100% convinced that the design supports the right message for Mailchimp. Perhaps this is more a critique of the marketing considerations of this rebrand (as opposed to the design ones).</p>

<h2 id="identity-a-balancing-act">Identity: A Balancing Act</h2>

<p>A brand’s identity isn’t solely determined by its stakeholders; it’s negotiated with an audience over the brand’s lifetime. One of the most difficult aspects of rebranding is balancing the internal desire to redefine a company’s communication strategy with the need resonate with customers, representing their shared history and experiences with the brand. Mailchimp’s choice of a primary marketing message may make that somewhat difficult.</p>

<h3 id="the-overarching-message">The Overarching Message</h3>

<p>From Mailchimp Design:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mailchimp has always been a little bit different… We want to show our customers that building a successful business means <strong>staying true to yourself.</strong> With this brand identity and design system, we hope to inspire them to be bold and creative with their own brands.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-design-decisions">The Design Decisions</h3>

<p>The overarching message of staying true to yourself and being bold and creative are primarily supported by the following new design elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the rough, expressive, and naïve illustration style</li>
  <li>Cooper Light: a quirky typeface with a correspondingly odd vernacular history (“You may have seen its larger cousin on dusty old funk records and inside questionable sandwich shops.”)</li>
</ul>

<figure>
<img alt="Mailchimp qualities" src="/assets/img/2018-09-27-mailchimp-qualities.webp" />
<figcaption>Bold and creative to be sure… but is Mailchimp staying true to itself?</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h2 id="the-disconnect">The Disconnect</h2>

<p><strong>The biggest potential issue with Mailchimp’s rebrand is that it doesn’t strongly connect its new marketing message to the value proposed by its existing portfolio of products and services.</strong> The pitch for customers to <em>be bold and creative</em> presents a vision that is perhaps too wide and ambitious to resonate powerfully with real customer goals in the present. It seems as if Mailchimp is paying more attention to who or what it wants to be to its customers than to what customers expect and desire from its offerings.</p>

<p>Take a look at Mailchimp’s current products. To be fair, the email and landing page templates are key offerings that are indeed geared towards creative empowerment, but how easily does something like segmentation inspire boldness and creativity? In contrast, how many of these products and services are concerned with helping businesses reach people in better ways? (<em>Hint: literally, all of them are about that.</em>)</p>

<figure>
<img alt="Mailchimp portfolio" src="/assets/img/2018-09-27-mailchimp-portfolio.webp" />
<figcaption>Here’s what Mailchimp actually offers customers.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At present, the primary marketing message (and as a result, the look and feel of the rebrand) seem somewhat out-of-touch with what Mailchimp actually <em>does</em> (or rather, what it has done historically). With email marketing having been the company’s bread and butter and the central touchpoint for its customers since its inception, it’s not hard to imagine some other directions the rebrand could have gone in.</p>

<p>The concept of mail and traditional postage’s historical role in cementing human connections are ripe with readymade marketing metaphors for how a business can improve communications with its customers. Plenty of the playful design language that the agencies ultimately landed on can be housed under marketing messages more concerned with what the company actually offers: business solutions for reaching people.</p>

<p>When it comes to examples of brands that have navigated this divide adeptly, I think back to the popular G Suite advertisement which imagines Hall &amp; Oates collaborating on the lyrics to <em>Maneater</em> in Google Docs. The message resonated well with customers because it included the spirit of originality and playfulness that Mailchimp is clearly after with this rebrand. However, it did so without deviating from the central value prop of the product: collaborative word processing.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="more-than-email">More Than Email</h2>

<p>At this point, it’s pretty clear that Mailchimp is seeking to define itself beyond the confines of the email marketing niche (they even said so). It also seems somewhat ironic that they chose to focus on inspiring and enabling creativity when that focus is disconnected from the parts of the business which practically extend beyond email: connection, automation, and optimization.</p>

<figure>
<img alt="more than email" src="/assets/img/2018-09-27-more-than-email.webp" />
</figure>

<p>David Martinez also made a solid point about the rebrand appearing to understate the company’s success in the email marketing niche. Mailchimp’s new approach doesn’t seem very reflective of the actual impact and scale of one of (if not) the largest email marketing platforms on the web experiencing daily growth on the order of 14K+ customers. The rebrand may be just as incongruent with what users want and expect out of the company’s products.</p>

<p>Is it fair to ask why Mailchimp feels the need to aggressively outgrow its roots? Is the company failing to embrace its own stated brand value of staying true to itself? It’s great that Mailchimp wants to inspire originality in brands that adopt it for marketing, but what if that’s not the value prop that customers are connecting with?</p>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>

<p>Pressing questions aside, I’m inclined to give Mailchimp the benefit of the doubt overall. Aiming to inspire originality and creativity instead of simply helping businesses reach people with better marketing services is an ambitious endeavor to say the least, and I respect that. It’s a bold decision to eschew the more banal SaaS marketing and branding tropes in favor of a mission that means something important to Mailchimp’s team and their story. The caveat is that I’m not sure whether or not a new brand identity and design system alone are enough to inspire users in that fashion.</p>

<blockquote class="bigquote">
If Mailchimp truly desires to be more than mail and empower creativity, its product offerings may need to evolve in tandem with its new brand philosophy.
</blockquote>

<p>Design templates are a start, but will Mailchimp introduce any new offerings to truly assist brands in finding and crafting their bold, courageous, creative, and authentic voices? Only time will tell, but I’m excited to see what unfolds since the company has teased more to come. It’s clear that Mailchimp has embraced the decisions underlying its new brand identity as a living set of principles intended to evolve with the business instead of edicts set in stone and that’s a very good thing.</p>

<p>Congrats to all teams involved with the new rollout!</p>

<p><em>Cool news: I’ve been working with the leadership team at Designers Guild to launch an online mentorship program this September. Designers Guild is a community of 10,000+ designers committed to discussing, learning, and growing together. The outpouring of interest in our upcoming program (over 400 pupils and 100 mentors have applied) encouraged us to open up a dialogue about mentorship expectations and experiences. Here are some of my stories.</em></p>

<h2 id="my-first-mentor">My first mentor</h2>

<p>My first mentorship experience began after I started contracting freelance design work in high school. (This was the start of my design career around eight or nine years ago.) After a couple years of independently learning how to design and code, a friend’s dad commissioned me to produce a website for his legal firm. I was around 15 years old and it was my first freelance gig. It went well and I quickly landed another project via referral, this one with a senior designer on it.</p>

<p>This designer—who became my first mentor—was in his 50s with a lot of more traditional agency experience. Our communication styles meshed well and we got along instantly. My skillset complemented his experience well. He would handle the clients, lead design direction, manage projects, and present work. I filled in the gaps with my knowledge of technology and new media. We’ve worked together on a lot of projects since.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>I learned about the administrative and hustling aspects of freelance work; my communication skills with clients and collaborators flourished.</li>
  <li>I gained a ton of confidence and experience through immersion.</li>
  <li>I began a long relationship with someone who remains an important part of my professional support network.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>There was a generational gap between our hard skillsets.</li>
  <li>I didn’t frequently get opportunities to push the limits of my skills or creative sensibilities.</li>
  <li>Some of the work and clients became less appealing over the years as my interests matured; I sought more opportunities for growth.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-second-mentor">My second mentor</h2>

<p>It was the summer after my first year of design school and I’d been working alongside my first mentor for a couple years. It surprised me to learn that his wife was a renowned food photographer. He got me a second job managing her studio while I worked a design internship. Despite not being a designer, she became my second mentor. I learned far more from her than at my internship that summer.</p>

<p>My old mentor left agency life behind for a more flexible freelance routine, but his wife was the hardest hustler I had ever met. Alongside shooting, she ran a brick-and-mortar studio that doubled as an event space. She had a lot more administrative overhead to manage. She set the bar high for me and pushed me very hard, but never failed to praise and reward me when I met her expectations.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>I learned a ton about entrepreneurship and the day-to-day details of running a business (versus freelancing).</li>
  <li>Managing and facilitating larger on-site productions became second nature. Necessity forced me to learn many things quickly.</li>
  <li>I began to understand that I liked providing value more than making things. I felt most rewarded when my skills worked in tandem to maximize the value I could provide.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>My hard skills and career trajectory were even more misaligned than they were with my previous mentor.</li>
  <li>Working two jobs led to my first experience with burnout the following semester.</li>
  <li>I possessed neither the foresight nor soft skills to make lasting connections in a parallel creative industry.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-last-mentor">My last mentor</h2>

<p>My last mentor was assigned to me in design school. In hindsight, I didn’t have the social/emotional maturity to take full advantage of that relationship. The fact that school was a more pressurized environment exacerbated this. I loved my mentor’s energy as a person, but her communication style wasn’t compatible with mine. I felt that she was rather abstract and indirect at times. Even though I studied graphic design in a program of my choice, the perfect mentor was elusive. Finding someone with a matching philosophy, skillset, and communication style was difficult. Prompted by our skillset incongruence, my mentor instructed me to seek other advisors. This became an obstacle to transparency, resulting in negative feedback on important work.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>She bolstered my focus on ethics. She once said she’d eat canned soup every night if it meant she got to do the work that made her proud.</li>
  <li>She never stopped encouraging me to write.</li>
  <li>I grew after-the-fact by learning from my failures.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Our communication styles were incompatible.</li>
  <li>Our philosophies, skills, and career trajectories were somewhat mismatched.</li>
  <li>The pressurized environment and academic consequences led to a decline in my confidence.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="key-takeaways-from-my-mentorship-experiences">Key takeaways from my mentorship experiences</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>One of the most crucial aspects of a mentor-pupil relationship is communicative compatibility.</strong> Ideas don’t mean anything (or may even become harmful) when lost in translation.</li>
  <li><strong>Experience is the best teacher.</strong> Sometimes, it’s quite important that a mentor has walked the (approximate) path that a pupil would like to take in their career.</li>
  <li>Despite a mismatch in hard skills or career trajectory, a pupil can still learn a lot from a mentor. <strong>Sometimes what complements a pupil’s hard skills and fills in the gaps can be just as—if not more—important to their long-term success.</strong></li>
  <li>A good mentor will challenge pupils, hold them accountable, and examine failures to create teachable moments, but will also <strong>remember to reward and praise pupils, emphasizing their strengths.</strong></li>
  <li>Good mentors usually ask a lot of questions before giving advice. <strong>Inquiry before judgment is a strong general principle for teachers.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Pupils are responsible for pulling the best out of their mentors</strong>—not just the other way around. Pupils must be proactive and learn to actively solicit mentor input to meet their unique needs.</li>
</ul>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<p>My most recent relationship with a mentor was my most difficult, but I may have grown the most from it. I learned how to be more proactive and ask for what I need. I realized how important a good cultural and environmental fit is to the success of individuals and institutions. I learned about my limitations and what I could do to address them.</p>

<p>Overall, my experiences have left me with a desire for a mentor whose philosophy, experience, and goals more closely match my interests. I’m at a point in my career where I know a bit more about what I want than I did in design school. Failing that, at least I know which questions I’ve got to ask to find the right answers. Finding a strong fit and learning from community feedback are what I’m most excited about when it comes to starting a new mentorship program.</p>

<p>I’d like to conclude this story with some wisdom from Sister Corita Kent: a notable educator in the arts. Below are her famous rules for the Immaculate Heart College Art Department. Many of them apply to relationships between mentors and pupils.</p>

<figure>
<img alt="Sister Corita Kent's ten rules" src="/assets/img/2018-08-27-ten-rules.webp" />
</figure>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>RULE 1: Find a place you trust, and then try trusting it for awhile.</em></p>

  <p><em>RULE 2: General duties of a student — pull everything out of your teacher; pull everything out of your fellow students.</em></p>

  <p><em>RULE 3: General duties of a teacher — pull everything out of your students.</em></p>

  <p><em>RULE 4: Consider everything an experiment.</em></p>

  <p><em>RULE 5: Be self-disciplined — this means finding someone wise or smart and choosing to follow them. To be disciplined is to follow in a good way. To be self-disciplined is to follow in a better way.</em></p>

  <p><em>RULE 6: Nothing is a mistake. There’s no win and no fail, there’s only make.</em></p>

  <p><em>RULE 7: The only rule is work. If you work it will lead to something. It’s the people who do all of the work all of the time who eventually catch on to things.</em></p>

  <p><em>RULE 8: Don’t try to create and analyze at the same time. They’re different processes.</em></p>

  <p><em>RULE 9: Be happy whenever you can manage it. Enjoy yourself. It’s lighter than you think.</em></p>

  <p><em>RULE 10: “We’re breaking all the rules. Even our own rules. And how do we do that? By leaving plenty of room for X quantities.” (John Cage)</em></p>

  <p><em>HELPFUL HINTS: Always be around. Come or go to everything. Always go to classes. Read anything you can get your hands on. Look at movies carefully, often. Save everything — it might come in handy later.</em></p>

  <p><em>There should be new rules next week.</em></p>

<p class="mt-200"><em>Q&amp;A is a column in which I’ll post long-form answers to thought-provoking questions. This particular question was inspired by a thread in [Designers Guild](https://facebook.com/groups/designguild), a Facebook community that I moderate. Designers Guild consists of 10,000+ designers committed to discussing, learning, and growing together.</em></p>

<h2 class="mt-200">The question</h2>

<p><em>Recently, pixel artist and game designer <a href="https://twitter.com/rayslynyrd">Slynyrd</a> published a great <a href="http://www.slynyrd.com/blog/2018/1/10/pixelblog-1-color-palettes">blog post</a> walking readers through a process for creating awesome pixel art color palettes. The tutorial focuses on selecting colors by manipulating HSB properties (hue, saturation, and brightness). This prompted a question about designers’ favorite ways to mix color.</em></p>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h2 id="the-answer">The answer</h2>

<p>I’ve always found generating HSB swatches to be the most intuitive method for novice designers to make color selections. Generating a single swatch with the HSB scales feels the most analogous to picking out a swatch from a color book in real life: you basically choose the general color you want (hue) then filter down to find your swatch by selecting for finer attributes of that general color (saturation and brightness). These three properties of a color are what give the scale its name (HSB = hue, saturation, brightness).</p>

<p>However, over the last couple years, I’ve taken a liking to directly mixing RGB in many situations (especially when it comes to building out larger palettes). Instead of picking swatches from a color book, it’s more analogous to mixing paint in a palette (except that mixing in RGB is additive rather than subtractive, so it’s technically mixing light; more on this later). RGB is named for the three channels of light mixed to produce an onscreen color (RGB = red, green, blue).</p>

<p><strong>Like a swatch book, HSB provides a great scale for <em>finding</em> a color.</strong> It can be useful for pinning down a match for the color you’ve seen in your head, on a screen, or in the real world. <strong>Like a painter’s palette, RGB provides a great space for <em>mixing</em> color.</strong> It can be used to create organic and harmonious relationships between two or more colors in a palette.</p>

<figure>
<img alt="color mixing" src="/assets/img/2018-02-05-mixing.webp" />
<figcaption>While HSB can be like a swatch book for finding colors, RGB can be like a palette for mixing them.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="the-main-idea">The main idea</h3>

<p>To start mixing in RGB, think of each channel as a bucket of red, green, or blue paint. With 8 bits per channel, you have 256 levels of granularity for how much of that color you want to mix in; 255 is the whole bucket, 192 = three quarters, 128 = half bucket, 64 = quarter bucket, and so on. Once in the ballpark, you can adjust the mix by finer increments (e.g. 4 = 1/64 bucket).</p>

<figure>
<img alt="red channel" src="/assets/img/2018-02-05-red-channel.webp" />
<figcaption>Removing color from the red channel results in darker, less saturated reds. At 64, the channels is 1/4 full.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>What I like about this method:</strong> preserving the channel ratios across colors and finding ways to recombine and riff on them can create more natural color harmonies amongst all of the swatches that end up in my palette. There’s something poetic about building color palettes by using the parameters of the color space itself as mixing model. When I finally got comfortable with this method, it felt a little like when I first understood how to utilize the grid for layouts; you’re not just picking a set of colors that look good, you’re outlining a system that encourages discretionary relationships in order to arrive at it.</p>

<figure>
<img alt="channel mixing" src="/assets/img/2018-02-05-channel-mixing.webp" />
<figcaption>Channel ratios: the cerulean and yellow swatches above both have equal amounts of green (3/4 channel) mixed into another full channel (either blue or red).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>By simply swapping a full blue channel for a red one, we’ve arrived at a yellow that complements the cerulean quite nicely.</p>

<h3 id="comparison-with-hsb">Comparison with HSB</h3>

<p>Comparatively, the same result can be attained in HSB by shifting the hue +210º (7/12) or -150º (-5/12). This exercise can often get a little more arbitrary for two main reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Different hues are affected unequally by brightness and saturation shifts as a result of varying <em>natural</em> value and chroma (for example, at a given saturation and brightness we still perceive a yellow hue as brighter than a violet one). The perceptual distance between a pure hue and white for example can also vary depending on which hue you’re working with.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spatially mapping the distance from red to magenta onto the 360º of a circle can make for a less-than-intuitive visualization of hues. If color stops were placed in regular intervals along this scale, some shifts in hue might appear greater than others even though the stops are equidistant. This is also a result of the varying natural value and chroma of each hue. The best way to visually estimate which degrees correspond to which hues in HSB is with the old mnemonic from science class for the colors of the visible light spectrum: <em>Roy G. Biv</em> (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet). Notice that this doesn’t map too cleanly onto the color wheel in even increments (blue and indigo are off the mark).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<figure>
<img alt="color wheel" src="/assets/img/2018-02-05-color-wheel.webp" />
<figcaption>Visualizing hue in degrees is difficult. Using ~51.5º increments, blue and indigo are off the mark!</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>All that being said, mixing in HSB isn’t bad at all. Here’s a good <a href="https://learnui.design/blog/the-hsb-color-system-practicioners-primer.html">primer</a> on it. The rest of this answer will focus on the strengths of an RGB mixing process.</p>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h3 id="additive-vs-subtractive-color">Additive vs. Subtractive Color</h3>

<p>Something mentioned earlier was that RGB is <em>additive</em> rather than <em>subtractive</em>. What <em>additive</em> means is that adding more color information from any channel adds light to make brighter colors, ultimately resulting in white. You can see the summation of colors resulting in white in the color wheel graphic above as well as the diagram below. Compare this to <em>subtractive</em> mixing, where more color information subtracts light to make darker colors (ultimately black).</p>

<figure>
<img alt="additive and subtractive color" src="/assets/img/2018-02-05-additive=subtractive.webp" />
<figcaption>Additive color adds light to make white. Subtractive color subtracts light to make black.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="example-cool-gradient">Example: Cool Gradient</h3>

<p>Here’s an example of how I like to mix colors in RGB. We’ll begin a palette by making swatches to create this cool gradient:</p>

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/2018-02-05-cool-gradient.webp" />
</figure>

<h4 id="starting-with-blue">Starting with blue</h4>

<p>1. We know we want to start with a blue, so let’s just flood the blue channel all the way; <strong>RGB(0,0,255).</strong></p>

<figure>
<img alt="full blue channel" src="/assets/img/2018-02-05-blue-swatch.webp" />
<figcaption>Flooding the blue channel all the way gets us a deep blue.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>2. Good start, but it’s too dark and just too blue.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We’d like a lighter color—remember that since RGB is additive, we can get that by adding color information to another channel.</li>
  <li>We’re going to be matching it with a greener hue, so it makes sense that the channel we add should be green.</li>
  <li>Looking back at the additive color diagram, mixing a full blue channel with a full green channel results in cyan. We want a lighter blue but not <em>that</em> light.</li>
  <li>We can add green in small amounts like mixing paint in to find a sweet spot. What if we split our channel (256 levels) into eighths (256/8 = 32)? That way, every time we add 32 levels to the green channel, it’s like moving 1/8 of the way from full blue to cyan.</li>
</ul>

<figure>
<img alt="blue channel levels" src="/assets/img/2018-02-05-blue-swatches.webp" />
<figcaption>Adding 32 (1/8) green each time gradually creates a lighter blue (moving towards cyan).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>That last iteration looks pretty good; blue, but not too dark and not too saturated. We also have a really clean ratio between channels: <strong>RGB(0,96,255) = 0:3:8 RGB ratio.</strong></p>

<h4 id="from-blue-to-green">From blue to green</h4>

<p>Now that we have a nice blue swatch, let’s get another concordant swatch going. Looking at our intended result, we want this one to be greener and a good bit brighter.</p>

<p>1. Let’s take care of <em>greener</em> first.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remember that our first color was predominantly blue, but had a little green added to move it towards cyan.</li>
  <li>Swapping the values for the G and B channels will get us a color that is equidistant from cyan, but predominantly green instead of blue.</li>
</ul>

<figure>
<img alt="blue and green channels" src="/assets/img/2018-02-05-blue-green-swatches.webp" />
<figcaption>Swapping the values of the blue and green channels gives us an analogous green swatch.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>2. Lookin’ alright! These swatches already feel quite analogous in terms of brightness and saturation because they share similar channel ratios.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Both swatches are equidistant from white in the color space since the total amount color in both swatches is equivalent. Both have 351 levels (96 + 255), but they’re just distributed inversely across the blue and green channels.</li>
  <li>The analogous nature of the colors is enforced by our logical use of the additive color chart. Essentially, the result of inverting the channel values was to reflect our original color across the cyan axis of the chart.</li>
</ul>

<p>3. We’re off to a good start, but looking back at our intended result, we want a cooler palette that might call for a bluer green with a lighter touch; something closer to cyan but not quite.</p>

  <li>We know that adding blue will get us there, but how much blue do we need? This is a good time to revisit the channel ratios.</li>
  <li><strong>RGB(0,255,96) = 0:8:3 RGB ratio…</strong> what if we just mixed in double the amount of blue? This would get us a 0:8:6 ratio — not all the way to cyan but enough to cool our green down.</li>

<p>Looks like the sweet spot: a nice, strong aquamarine with a 0:8:6 RGB ratio. The ratio keeps our channels in 8 parts and plays really nicely with our other color’s 0:3:8 ratio.</p>

<figcaption>We’ve now mixed both the swatches necessary for our original cool gradient.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>From this point, we can shuffle the ratios even more to discover additional harmonious swatches inside the spectrum we’ve just established. We can make more minute adjustments using the same logic of splitting the channel levels into smaller fractions. We can bring in some of the starting blues from before for dark swatches, or even start incorporating the red channel into our existing ratios to get more contrasting colors. There are a lot of places to go, but hopefully, this example illustrates the thinking behind building more organic color relationships in the RGB color space.</p>

<p><em>I made a 2-minute YouTube tutorial for a neat trick to visualize hexadecimal triplets that abridges some information found in the rest of the article. You can use this method as a practical shortcut in your work or as a cool party trick.</em></p>

<h3 id="hexadecimal-colors">Hexadecimal colors</h3>

<p>An additional bonus of mixing directly in the RGB color space is that we can garner a more intuitive understanding of its hexadecimal representations. Because a color’s hexadecimal representation (e.g. #0060FF) maps to its RGB values, mixing in RGB can gradually acquaint us more with these hex codes up to the point where we’re even mixing colors directly in hex. Here’s how to convert a hexadecimal color to its decimal RGB values:</p>

<p>1. Split your hex number into 3 groups of 2 characters.</p>

<ul>
  <li>e.g. #0060FF = 00 | 60 | FF</li>
  <li>Each group now represents the R, G, or B channel respectively</li>
</ul>

<p>2. Keep in mind that even the letters here are <em>digits</em>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>00 in the red channel means 0 red… simple enough</li>
  <li>But FF = 255? <em>What?</em></li>
  <li>We’re used to digits in a <em>decimal</em> system. <em>Dec</em> = 10; 10 digits (0–9).</li>
  <li><em>Hex</em> = 6 and <em>dec</em> = 10; <em>hexadecimal</em> uses 16 digits (0–F).</li>
  <li>We already know how to count from 0–9, but in hexadecimal, we just keep counting with letters (A = 10, B = 11, …, F = 15). Just imagine the letters as a single-digit representation of what would ordinarily be a number from 10–15 in our common decimal system.</li>
</ul>

<figure>
<img alt="decimal to hexadecimal digit conversion" src="/assets/img/2018-02-05-decimal-hexadecimal.webp" />
<figcaption>The sixteen hexadecimal digits (0–F) represent decimal values from 0–15.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>3. To convert your hex number to the decimal value for the channel:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Take the digit in the “tens” place (really the “sixteens” place in hex) and multiply it by 16 (or 16¹).</li>
  <li>Then take the digit in the “ones” place [and multiply it by 1 (or 16⁰)].</li>
  <li>Add the two together to get your decimal value.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="conversion-example">Conversion example</h4>

<p>Converting #0060FF to RGB:</p>

<figure>
<img alt="hexadecimal to decimal RGB conversion" src="/assets/img/2018-02-05-hex-conversion.webp" />
<figcaption>Conversion table for hexadecimal to decimal RGB</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>#0060FF = RGB(0,96,255)</strong></p>

<p>You can reverse this process by dividing (Euclidean division) your decimal RGB value by 16. The quotient goes in the “tens” place of the hex number and the remainder goes in the “ones” place.</p>

<p>Converting RGB(0,96,255) to hexadecimal:</p>

<p><strong>RGB(0,96,255) = #0060FF</strong></p>

<h4 id="approximating-hexadecimal-channel-ratios">Approximating hexadecimal channel ratios</h4>

<p>The mental math for exact hex conversions can be slow and confusing at first. The best way to develop an intuition for how hexadecimal RGB works is just to approximate: you’ll get sharper and sharper with time until it’s second nature. Here’s an easy approximation scheme:</p>

<p>1. Split the hex string into 3 groups of 2 characters just like you would for a conversion to decimal.</p>

<p>2. Round each channel’s value to the nearest 0.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the second digit is 8 or above, round up (e.g. 3A rounds to 40); you can round high Fs to a theoretical G0</li>
  <li>Otherwise round down (e.g. 37 rounds to 30)</li>
</ul>

<figure>
<img alt="hexadecimal rounding" src="/assets/img/2018-02-05-decimal-hexadecimal-01.webp" />
<figcaption>Hexadecimal digits 8–F round up; 0–7 round down.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>3. You now have a rough ratio for your channel mix: the first digit tells you approximately how many <em>sixteenths</em> of that color you’ve added.</p>

<p>For example: <strong>#873AFF</strong> rounds to <strong>80 | 40 | G0</strong>. 8/16 red, 4/16 green, and 16/16 blue gives us an approximate <strong>2:1:4 RGB ratio</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remember when we added green by 1/8 increments to our first blue swatches? 1/8 = 2/16; you can clearly see us adding 2/16 of green each time the first digit in the green channel’s hex number increases by 2.</li>
</ul>

<figure>
<img alt="blue channel values" src="/assets/img/2018-02-05-blue-swatches-01.webp" />
<figcaption>Each time the first digit in the green channel’s hex number increases by 2, it’s like adding 2/16 of green.</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
  <li>You’re in good shape when you get to the point where you can look at <em>#0060FF</em> and quickly tell that it’s full blue with some green mixed in (a little less than half the channel).</li>
  <li>Using our estimation technique from above, we can quickly see 6/16 green and 16/16 blue which simplifies to “3 parts green, 8 parts blue.” At this point, you’re seeing hexadecimal RGB color like a painter sees a palette.</li>
</ul>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<p>So there you have it, a primer for getting started with mixing in RGB. To recap, some of the advantages of mixing in RGB are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ability to create more organic color relationships using channel ratios</li>
  <li>The opportunity to arrive at color palettes using a system that encourages discretionary relationships (much like the grid does for layouts)</li>
  <li>The congruence of building color palettes using the parameters of the color space itself as mixing model</li>
  <li>Not having to worry about the sometimes arbitrary effects of saturation and brightness on different hues or the 360º of the color wheel</li>
  <li>The convenience of developing an understanding of working with hexadecimal RGB color</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Happy mixing!</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Design will save the world!</em></strong> It’s a sentiment that everybody and their mom has heard at this point. Kanye proudly <a href="http://grist.org/cities/kanye-west-says-design-can-save-the-world-students-respond/">proclaimed it</a>. David Carson <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/798568-graphic-design-will-save-the-world-right-after-rock-and">cheekily lampooned it</a>. Perhaps Mike Monteiro <a href="https://deardesignstudent.com/can-design-save-the-world-8d3c1cd0efe7">articulated it best</a> in a moment of critical realness aimed at this sentiment that so unabashedly represents the self-celebratory nature of design as an industry:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>…the world isn’t usually changed by special people. It’s changed by ordinary people… Yes, designers can change the world. But it’s because we have the same responsibility as every other ordinary person.</em></p>

  <p><cite>—Mike Monteiro, <em>Can Design Change the World?</em></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve thought a lot about social and civic responsibility… a lot about what I may owe to my immediate community and the world at large for investing in me as I’ve grown into the person that I am today. Once upon a time, I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my future as a designer, I will exercise my potential to call other members of a global community to action for a better tomorrow by creating engaging experiences and tools that enable others to do the same on a multiplied scale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ever since then, I’ve been striving as best I can to identify pathways which allow me to embody that mission in the work I like to do. The years since I penned that statement have been filled with a good deal of experimentation, some successes, many failures, and several valuable lessons and discoveries. My search to fulfill my mission in a way that’s meaningful to me has encouraged a desire to explore aggressively.</p>

<p>It was advice that I was at first hesitant to follow, but upon consideration it felt like a good fit for my personality. There’s a golden moment in an episode of <em>The Knowledge Project</em> podcast featuring Naval Ravikant where he refers to this idea as the important transition in his career from a phase of exploration to one of execution. The <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/18-naval-ravikant-the-angel-philosopher/id990149481?i=1000381983198">entire episode</a> is filled to the brim with a lot of other sage advice. It helps that I’ve always been a person who enjoys pursuing many (sometimes disparate) endeavors. Here are the cliff notes of what I’ve tried since writing that statement which abstractly identifies my motives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I declared a minor where I learned about digital fabrication, algorithmic music, and a myriad of other things that weren’t exactly design-related.</li>
  <li>I helped launch an educational technology company called Kadenze to make arts and technology education more accessible and affordable.</li>
  <li>I toured several studios and agencies in New York and California wondering if that life could ever work for me.</li>
  <li>I graduated from CalArts!</li>
  <li>I interviewed for a small number of design positions in California through recruiters who were interested in my work. The opportunities seemed good on paper, but none of them really panned out. I must admit that I was more motivated to pursue them by financial pressures than by passion; for the most part, their missions never quite felt as meaningful as the work I was doing before.</li>
  <li>I wanted to learn more about the intersection of entrepreneurship and design, so I spent some time consulting for a couple early-stage technology companies in Palo Alto.</li>
  <li>I traveled to Liverpool, England to attend my first business conference, and to Florence, Italy to meet an engineering team.</li>
  <li>I saw a lot of other interesting things in Europe. My visit to the Bauhaus Archive in Berlin was highly emotional.</li>
  <li>I worked on numerous side-projects including a resource aggregator for Google’s TensorFlow library, a web application for genetics researchers, and tour promotions, album artwork, and websites for various independent artists and musicians.</li>
  <li>I became a moderator for <a href="http://facebook.com/groups/designguild/">Designers Guild</a>, an online community of over 10,000 designers committed to learning and growing together.</li>
  <li>Most importantly: <strong>I helped people whenever possible. I learned that I genuinely just love supporting others. Helping people simultaneously makes me feel useful and feels like the best use of my time; ideal.</strong></li>

<p>Reconciling lessons from all of my experiences and understanding how to unify them into a workable vision for my future was going to take substantive consideration. I have Jenny Earnest to thank for pointing me in the right direction when she gifted me a copy of the 2017 edition of <em>What Color is Your Parachute?</em>, a classic job-hunting best-seller by Richard N. Bolles. I particularly appreciated the book’s helpful suggestion to perform a “self-inventory” so that I might craft that vision with integrity on the basis of my most genuine self — merits, flaws, and all.</p>

<h3 id="listen-to-your-friends">Listen to your friends?</h3>

<p>A thousand scattered conversations with friends also punctuated that period of deep self-reflection. Some memories of those back-and-forths remain more salient than others. I remember one mathematician friend throwing quite the jab after one of my extended musings about technology’s potential to elicit social change on a gargantuan scale.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What are you gonna do, give people better iPhones?</em> 🙄</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was being a jerk… but more importantly, he was being a jerk with a fair point. For all my belief in the ideals of social responsibility, that incisive retort deftly forced me to recognize and admit that the comforts and promises of ergonomic office chairs and steady paychecks always came first. It proved to be ammunition for further reflection. <em>What am I really here to do?</em></p>

<h3 id="search-your-feelings">Search your feelings</h3>

<p>Building relationships and pursuing community-oriented work struck a nerve with me for some reason. Maybe it’s because of all the online communities that have shaped my evolution as a designer over the last decade. Helping and encouraging others in various more socially hands-on roles tended to return a distinctly powerful energy which I frequently felt was missing from my work. The self-inventory process began to accelerate as I started to readily identify similarly meaningful feelings which had arisen in previous work contexts.</p>

<p>One sentiment that stuck with me from my time in edtech was a festering disillusionment concerning how distant and removed I felt from the people I was helping. Many amazing, smart, and talented people benefitted from the reach of the work I was doing and I got to meet some of them on my journey. It was quite rewarding to have had a role in shaping people’s decisions about their lives and careers and exposing them to pathways that they’re incredibly passionate about. That wider impact always made me much prouder than any product deliverables or any direct work outcomes. Despite that pride, I still couldn’t shake the feeling that I was effecting change from behind a desk. My intuition told me that I wanted a deeper level of intimacy with and empathy for people who don’t have access to some of the learning opportunities that I’ve been lucky enough to enjoy.</p>

<h3 id="talk-to-experienced-people">Talk to experienced people</h3>

<p>Another lasting and impactful influence was a conversation I had with my cousin Obi during my time in Palo Alto. Obi Okobi was a product of the Harvard Graduate School of Education who went on to become a principal in Baltimore, Maryland’s school systems so I figured she was the perfect person to talk to about my job and interests in education. She was seated next to me at a celebratory dinner last year for my brother’s graduation from Stanford and we ended up having a very stimulating conversation about creativity’s role in education.</p>

<p>Sadly, that was the last conversation I’d ever have with my dear cousin. Shortly afterward, tragedy struck and Obi succumbed to a medical emergency at the all-too-early age of forty. In this loss were powerful lessons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It isn’t rational to indefinitely defer our urges to investigate feelings that resonate with our true selves. We never know when the day may come that we run out of chances to do so. <strong>When something meaningful calls to us, we should at worst, find a way to explore that energy with mitigated risk, or at best, pursue that calling with vigor.</strong></li>
  <li>Obi’s life was a life of service and that was very much reflected in the way people chose to remember her. I’d like to be remembered in a similar fashion—as somebody who dedicated themself to service and lead by example in that regard (as Obi has been a leader for me).</li>
</ul>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h2 id="on-finding-paving-a-way">On finding (paving) a way</h2>

<p>Making service a priority is easier said than done. Like any other worthwhile thing in life, committing to a mission and figuring out a way to make it work may require no small amount of sacrifice. Learning to part with things you hold dear in order to evolve is one of the hardest things to learn while growing up—but in retrospect, learning lessons the hard way has always worked fairly well for me. At certain times, there is no greater motivator than the prospect of failure. However, nearly all the time, there is no greater teacher than the acceptance thereof.</p>

<h3 id="do-whats-necessary">Do what’s necessary</h3>

<p>In order to ambitiously commit, take risks, help others, and understand my purpose, I had to identify failures in my life, accept them, and make difficult decisions about how to deal with them in order to move past them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I chose to undergo therapy to ensure that I could take care of my own mental and emotional health as I transitioned into adulthood. I learned that much of life concerns reacting to events in a way that prioritizes growth.</li>
  <li>I chose to start accepting more responsibility and to hold myself accountable whenever I could identify a personal failure. I learned that even when entirely legitimate, blame is a formidable obstacle to progress.</li>
  <li>I chose to get off the bench, put up more shots, and keep taking some risks. I learned that establishing a framework for managing risk and exercising it with discipline can be rewarding in cases of both failure and success.</li>
  <li>I chose to part with a toxic family environment that was feeding my negativity, stifling my growth, and systematically removing my self-belief. I learned that hard decisions may be momentarily painful but that I can and will survive through them to ultimately find greener pastures.</li>
  <li>I chose to relinquish most of my material possessions; I packed what I could carry on my back and left home. I learned to greatly expand the radius of my comfort zone by strongly distinguishing wants from needs and assets from liabilities when life got tough. I learned to appreciate my merits and worth as a human aside from perceived wealth and status.</li>
  <li>I chose to set moments aside where I could consciously appreciate the things I was grateful for. I learned that fortitude and optimism are habits cultivated through consistent practice.</li>
  <li>I chose to continue helping others whenever possible despite a drastic reduction in material resources. I learned that contributing to the lives of others can lend us more positive energy to fight our own battles as well.</li>
  <li>I chose to recognize when I truly need help and to ask for it. I learned that I don’t have to be a martyr in order to serve others or to lead by example to propagate the change I’d like to see; sometimes we all need support.</li>
</ul>

<p>When people solicit advice for how to improve their lives, they often default to an additive frame—<em>what more can I do to reach my goals?</em> Something often overlooked is that a subtractive approach can be equally or more beneficial—<em>what should I <strong>stop</strong> doing to reach my goals?</em> Once I simplified my life by removing conflicting variables and starting over with a bottom-up approach, it became a lot harder to lie to myself. I could see far more lucidly after the fog of cognitive dissonance had dissipated. I was still a bit lost, but in the words of some corny motivational poster, <strong><em>it feels good to be lost in the right direction.</em></strong></p>

<h3 id="do-what-feels-right">Do what feels right</h3>

<p>I suspect that by nature I’m largely a defensive pessimist: a person who protects themself and others by identifying reasons <em>not</em> to take some action. Unbalanced defensive pessimism is not a suitable disposition for someone who wishes to squeeze the most out of this life by taking intelligent risks, growing through failures, and earning the rewards of successes. I had to shed my propensity for deliberating in place of acting if I ever wanted to see beyond the horizons that were confining me to passive mediocrity.</p>

<p>One good thing about service is that it is righteous. Despite all of the logistical difficulties that committing to a mission of service entails, choosing whether or not to help people who are truly in need is one of the easiest moral and philosophical decisions I could ever place in front of myself. Combining that with my newfound independence and my resolution to radically accept responsibility was a surefire cure for debilitating pessimism. The facts were that I truly wanted to do something which I felt was entirely possible and that I had neither a moral nor philosophical reason not to; <strong>any other reason not to was merely an excuse not to commit.</strong> The only way I could rationalize those excuses now was to accept responsibility. <em>The only reason not to commit to something this righteous is a lack of willingness to slog through the difficulties along the way. The only reason not to follow through with this is because of a contentment with passive mediocrity.</em></p>

<h3 id="do-it">Do it.</h3>

<p>I followed through.</p>

<div class="soft-break"></div>

<h2 id="on-pursuing-commitment">On pursuing commitment</h2>

<p>Commitment is frightening. Committing to something truly worthwhile involves sacrifice, but moreover it demands steadfastness. Human beings are nomadic and dynamic creatures that crave change and novelty; remaining constant and stable in the face of shifting moods, environments, and circumstances is no easy task for us. Following through on commitments requires a tolerance for poor weather—the resolve to rise and power through the days when things get difficult or when the engine of raw passion doesn’t provide the thrust we so often rely on it for.</p>

<p>I found that when I learned to cope with the fact that my life circumstances got tougher, committing to long-term goals got much easier. I was no longer the kind of person who had to wait around until things were perfect to make decisions or take a big leap of faith. I knew now that I could start off in the right direction and adjust my course along the way. I recognized the benefits of maintaining an optimistic attitude and building upon positive momentum.</p>

<blockquote class="bigquote">I decided to commit half a year to volunteering in Thailand.</blockquote>

<p>I’m working at the <a href="https://www.fr-ray.org/">Father Ray Foundation</a> in Pattaya, an organization that provides a home and access to education to over 850 disadvantaged children and young people with disabilities. My role within the organization includes:</p>

<p>Commitment also forces one to reckon with the opportunity costs of investing deeply in something and promising to follow through. However, something I learned about paving my own path in life is that with a lot of determination and a little creativity, we can make difficult situations work to our advantage. In becoming a more flexible person, I came to understand that I really didn’t have to give up many of the things that truly appealed to me (especially things concerning my future). I could also choose to look at what opportunities long-term commitment <em>afforded</em>.</p>

<p><strong>I thought volunteering for six months would cost me the opportunity to land a steady job in my industry</strong> with a reasonable paycheck that could help me start my life as an independent adult. However, it afforded me a structure in which I could learn new skills, try many things, and deeply contemplate what things I enjoy working on most before making my next commitment. I am currently writing, designing, and doing more things that I’m passionate about than I have in a long time. I’m sure that my next move will be one that I am equally excited about instead of one which I settle for and I see everything as a positive step towards that outcome.</p>

<p><strong>I thought that moving to a different country would cost me the opportunity to fix things with my family.</strong> In reality, it afforded me distance to realize that everybody needs time to heal and that the nature of our relationships changes throughout our lifetimes as we grow and adjust with those around us. Navigating a different culture and teaching young people have taught me lessons in patience that extend to other areas of my life. It doesn’t come naturally, but I am finally permitting myself to be patient with my own growth; the peace of mind that brings to my life is quite invaluable.</p>

<p><strong>Lastly, I thought that committing to a mission of service far away from home would cost me the opportunity to spend time around my friends and the people I love.</strong> What I instead realized is that there is love to be found anywhere one goes and that it lifts us up, carries us through difficult times, and gives us the strength to surmount the challenges that shape us into the people that we wish to be. That reciprocity and appreciation make serving others an unparalleled privilege.</p>

<p><strong>To commit to and act on our love for others is to love ourselves.</strong> I’ll end with a warm quote from the whiteboard in the hallway this morning:</p>

<blockquote class="bigquote"><em>The heart of a volunteer is never measured in size, but by the depth of the commitment to make a difference in the lives of others.</em>
