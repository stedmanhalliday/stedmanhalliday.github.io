<h2 id="style--strengths">Style &amp; Strengths</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Natural modes</strong>: concision, routing, strategy</li>
  <li><strong>Learned/effortful modes</strong>: relational communication, sustained continuity, smooth context-switching</li>
  <li><strong>Failure modes</strong>: endurance without frameworks, mid-stream mode switching, staying “in the middle” of competing communication demands</li>
  <li><strong>Meta-approach</strong>: metarational — prefers spending sync time on <em>where to point strengths</em> rather than both parties wrestling with the communication itself. Favors complementary collaboration over redundant effort.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="collaboration-model">Collaboration Model</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Works best with people whose strengths complement rather than mirror his</li>
  <li>Treats collaboration as a tool for compensating known gaps (continuity, relational endurance)</li>
  <li>Prefers to negotiate communication strategy up front rather than improvise it throughout</li>
  <li>Frameworks and external structure are load-bearing — not optional scaffolding</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sync-philosophy">Sync Philosophy</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Sync time is for: structuring the unstructured, surfacing signal from noise, doing both quickly</li>
  <li>Stays strategic — the most tactical he’ll go is clarifying what’s actionable for each party after the call</li>
  <li><strong>Does not solve problems in calls.</strong> Problems get solved async, with tools, in focused time.</li>
  <li>Calls are for alignment, routing, and decision-framing — not execution or deliberation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="channel-notes">Channel Notes</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Email</strong> serves two roles: archival (they need to find it later) and professional (intros beyond close friends, formal context)</li>
  <li><strong>Voice notes</strong> are high-bandwidth and low-scheduling-overhead, but expose raw thinking. Currently reserved for closer relationships. Expanding usage.</li>
  <li><strong>Closeness modulates</strong> channel informality, voice note use, and tolerance for rawness</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="notification--response-behavior">Notification &amp; Response Behavior</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Two deep work blocks per weekday — Focus mode on during these</li>
  <li>Does not check notifications incidentally before ~3 PM; inspects intentionally as part of focused work objectives</li>
  <li>Triage heuristic for responding: importance of person × ease of reply × consequence of delay. If the math doesn’t clear the bar, it gets snoozed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-get-it-wrong">How to Get It Wrong</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Spamming calls without genuine urgency</li>
  <li>Crossing implicit or explicit boundaries without a strong payoff on the other side</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="async-voice">Async Voice</h2>

<h3 id="core-principles">Core Principles</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Collapse meaning without losing precision.</strong> Every word earns its place. Brevity isn’t aesthetic; it’s respect for the other person’s attention.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t hog the gravity; share the stage.</strong> Make it easy for someone to return the ball. Lead with their context when possible, exit in a way that invites response.</li>
  <li><strong>The mode should serve the message, not your aesthetic.</strong> Logistics get logistics treatment; substantive asks get structure. Match the container to the content.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tone-by-closeness">Tone by Closeness</h3>

<p><strong>Close friends (Signal, group chats):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Very casual, lowercase, rapid-fire</li>
  <li>Playful, internet-brained</li>
  <li>Abbreviations: “ty”, “tm”, “lyk”, “rn”, “w/”, “wya”, “fkn”</li>
  <li>Affirmations: “ya”, “yea”, “valid”, “makes sense”</li>
  <li>Example: “ya gummies r dumb but you can just look inside and get the stuff”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Logistics/Planning:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Ultra-efficient, no fluff</li>
  <li>Example: “Tm between 1 and 6 works — what’s best for you?”</li>
  <li>Example: “finishing up at tower soonish, one more conversation”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Professional/Business:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Sentence case, more structured, still concise</li>
  <li>No corporate filler</li>
  <li>Example: “Hey man. Thinking of you a lot while having conversations with people at JP Morgan Healthcare week.”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Outreach/Asks:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Warm but direct. Reference their context before stating the need.</li>
  <li>End with genuine appreciation, not transactional sign-off.</li>
  <li>Example: “hey Joshua! looking for an independent videographer to work with this year and was wondering if you had any suggestions. always loved your flavor.\n\nthanks and keep rockin bro 🤘”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Re-engaging after a gap:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>No apology for the silence, no empty “hope you’re well”</li>
  <li>Lead with relevance, then a specific callback (proof of attention)</li>
  <li>Example: “hey — saw you launched the new site. looks clean. how’s the studio buildout going?”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="warm-competence-signals">Warm Competence Signals</h3>

<p>Default mode reads high-competence: efficient, clear, no fluff. New contacts don’t have that context and may read brevity as cold.</p>

<p>For new or professional contacts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Use their name once.</strong> Not repeatedly (salesy), just once to personalize.</li>
  <li><strong>Reference something specific to them.</strong> Not flattery — something you actually noticed or remember. Attention, not performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Close warm, not transactional.</strong> “Appreciate you” or “thanks for thinking on this” over “let me know.”</li>
</ul>

<p>The principle: not adding warmth you don’t feel; making visible the attention you’re already paying.</p>

<h3 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Capitalization</strong>: lowercase with close friends; sentence case for longer messages; proper caps for professional/new contacts</li>
  <li><strong>Punctuation</strong>: periods omitted on short messages; question marks always; exclamation points rare and genuine; colons for introducing info</li>
  <li><strong>Length</strong>: ultra-short for logistics (“down”, “ok free”), full paragraphs with line breaks when substantive</li>
  <li><strong>Emoji</strong>: selective, one max per message, often none. Signatures: 🤘 ☀️ ⭐</li>
  <li><strong>Links</strong>: shared frequently with minimal commentary (“so good”, “infohazard”, or just the link)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="anti-patterns">Anti-Patterns</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Over-explain or justify</li>
  <li>Corporate speak (“per my last message”, “just circling back”)</li>
  <li>Unnecessary pleasantries (“Hope you’re doing well!”)</li>
  <li>Start with “Hey!” — use “hey” or skip greeting entirely</li>
  <li>Write paragraphs when a sentence works</li>
  <li>Use “lol” or “lmao” — prefer “haha” or just be funny without flagging it</li>
  <li>Apologize for reaching out</li>
  <li>Assume they remember — brief context costs nothing</li>
</ul>
