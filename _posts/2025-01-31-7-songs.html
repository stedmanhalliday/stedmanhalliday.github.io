<h3><em>Stone Woman Gives Birth To A Child At Night</em>‚ÄîMount Eerie</h3>
<p>I've spent much of autumn's turn to winter coasting around California in a sedan. I'm surprised at how long
    it's taken me to give the roads their fair due with amount of time I've lived in California while owning a car. When
    Mount Eerie's been on, I've found myself stopping more frequently to contemplate whatever's knocking at the
    threshold of my attention‚Äîa scenic vista or a mundane slice of time. Awareness has taken on a wide range of flavors
    from slow and viscous to bold, sweeping, and dynamic. It's an appropriate soundtrack for being present nowhere in
    particular.

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Circles</em>‚ÄîThrice</h3>
<p>There's something I truly appreciate about the way many gems from Thrice's wide-ranging discography allow themselves
    <a href="https://x.com/stedmanhalliday/status/1879417785857761549" target="_blank">to be found</a> and sat within
    time and again. <em>Beggars</em> is one of my favorite records and <em>Circles</em> is a highlight that's equal
    parts somber and expansive, with a small measure of twinkling hope. The lyrics characterize humans as intrepid yet
    futile in our perennial quests to cast ourselves into the dark and build upon what we know despite our ultimate
    ignorance, blindness, and fallibility. I haven't watched these guys play in over 10 years (since the last dates of
    their farewell tour pre-reunion); perhaps it's time to indulge a little nostalgia.

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Hey Listen</em>‚ÄîDrug Church</h3>
<p>Drug Church's <em>Prude</em> was one of my favorite releases of 2024. It doesn't break much new ground
    sonically, but the songs are well written despite their structural and lyrical simplicity. The tracklist is built
    with vignettes‚Äîoften crushing ones‚Äîof life on the other side of cracks in modern life that many people would rather
    just pretend aren't there (along with the people who've fallen through them). Hearing <em>Hey Listen</em> reminds me
    of an unlucky kid I used to get into trouble with when I was running low on luck myself. It makes me feel abruptly
    anxious and awfully guilty; sapped and resigned to abject cowardice, shame, and disappointment, yet ultimately
    grateful. It is indeed tough to find an upside, but there's no hope for luck without the intent to search. Thanks to
    <a href="https://x.com/em32label/status/1885020104917954783" target="_blank">Carlos Jarquin</a> for listening to me
    yap about sad shit. <a href="https://forms.gle/Dt7X7wBvobb9cPdC7" target="_blank">Go tell him</a> about a song that
    means something to you.

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Hollywood</em>‚ÄîToro y Moi, Benjamin Gibbard</h3>
<p>The end of last year saw me falling back into old patterns of landing myself in some total bullshit in Hollywood.
    Changing‚Äîtruly and permanently changing‚Äîis a tall order. I guess I'm working my way up to it, but it's really
    nobody's business to even try to help me with this stuff anymore. On an entirely separate note, instrumental
    production is resonating with me here as creative inspiration. I'm sitting on several years' worth of 8-bar guitar
    loops that need arrangements to call a home and I had a fun time bringing some field recordings of indigenous chants
    and my gamelan percussion fiddlings over to a local session with <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hexani"
        target="_blank">hex_</a> earlier this month. <em>I need to finish things!</em>

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>HEAL</em>‚ÄîMachinedrum, AKTHESAVIOR, Deniro Farrar</h3>
<p>Machinedrum's curatorial efforts on the compilation mentioned above came fresh off the heels of a deluxe LP release.
    <em>3FOR82_D3LUX3</em> brings even more solid cuts to the table than the original release from back in the spring
    and this track found me again at the right time in life to embed itself deeply in my rotation. It's been over 10
    years since the <em>Vapor City</em> era and somehow this guy is still finding new things to execute very well. I
    enjoy the range of experimentation in his crossovers into black music. Not everything hits for me‚Äîe.g. I don't
    <em>dislike</em> the Jesse Boykins III collaborations, but it's easy to find R&B I'm more fond of. <em>Kane
        Train</em> with Freddy Gibbs (2020) was a smash by comparison; a definitive step up in Machinedrum's ability to
    find a pocket in hip-hop production with vocal features. <em>HEAL</em> (2024) takes that deeper than production and
    performance into the realm of transcendent emotional appeal. It's perhaps a tad less instrumentally inventive but
    still exquisitely arranged, sitting behind the vocal where it needs to yet still placing variation and dynamic highs
    where they fit best. Stellar and moving vocal performance and message: life is hard... find a way to push through.

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Lullaby</em>‚ÄîTURQUOISEDEATH</h3>
<p>I've been riding around at night a lot with TURQUOISEDEATH. I'd comfortably put <em>Kaleidoscope</em> in the 2024
    sleepers category; definitely unexpected replay value. Solid balance of ethereal ambiance, danceable tempos, and
    pedal to the metal breakbeat-filled DnB/jungle-esque goodness‚Äînot terribly novel, but thoroughly enjoyable.
