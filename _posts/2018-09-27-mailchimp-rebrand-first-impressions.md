In case you haven‚Äôt heard, MailChimp is now Mailchimp. That‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs #rebrand season! Get an overview of what‚Äôs new on [*Fast Company*](https://www.fastcompany.com/90241616/see-mailchimps-weird-new-branding) and dive in a little deeper at [Mailchimp Design](https://mailchimp.com/design/).

*This article was inspired by a thread in [Designers Guild](https://facebook.com/groups/designguild), a Facebook community that I help moderate. Designers Guild consists of 10,000+ designers committed to discussing, learning, and growing together. Jon Bell (Senior Design Manager at Mailchimp) unveiled the company‚Äôs fresh rebrand (with support from Collins and R/GA) and asked the community for its thoughts. After digging into the work a little and sleeping on it yesterday, I had the opportunity to prepare some more fleshed out opinions this morning (prompted by Jenny Earnest).*

## Freddie Forever!

It‚Äôs nice when a rebrand can preserve the iconic elements of a company‚Äôs history, so I like that Mailchimp kept Freddie as a logo. The lockups with the new wordmark also look fantastic; they preserve the lighthearted quality of the old script logotype, but find harmony with Freddie‚Äôs weightier aesthetic. The team nailed the logo portion of this rebrand.

I enjoy how the other design elements (such as typography and illustration) coalesce and the Cavendish swatch dignifies everything pretty nicely. The aesthetic gestures are very appreciable on the surface, but after some more consideration, I‚Äôm not 100% convinced that the design supports the right message for Mailchimp. Perhaps this is more a critique of the marketing considerations of this rebrand (as opposed to the design ones).

## Identity: A Balancing Act

A brand‚Äôs identity isn‚Äôt solely determined by its stakeholders; it‚Äôs negotiated with an audience over the brand‚Äôs lifetime. One of the most difficult aspects of rebranding is balancing the internal desire to redefine a company‚Äôs communication strategy with the need resonate with customers, representing their shared history and experiences with the brand. Mailchimp‚Äôs choice of a primary marketing message may make that somewhat difficult.

### The Overarching Message

From Mailchimp Design:

> Mailchimp has always been a little bit different‚Ä¶ We want to show our customers that building a successful business means **staying true to yourself.** With this brand identity and design system, we hope to inspire them to be bold and creative with their own brands.

### The Design Decisions

The overarching message of staying true to yourself and being bold and creative are primarily supported by the following new design elements:

- the rough, expressive, and na√Øve illustration style
- Cooper Light: a quirky typeface with a correspondingly odd vernacular history (‚ÄúYou may have seen its larger cousin on dusty old funk records and inside questionable sandwich shops.‚Äù)

## The Disconnect

**The biggest potential issue with Mailchimp‚Äôs rebrand is that it doesn‚Äôt strongly connect its new marketing message to the value proposed by its existing portfolio of products and services.** The pitch for customers to *be bold and creative* presents a vision that is perhaps too wide and ambitious to resonate powerfully with real customer goals in the present. It seems as if Mailchimp is paying more attention to who or what it wants to be to its customers than to what customers expect and desire from its offerings.

Take a look at Mailchimp‚Äôs current products. To be fair, the email and landing page templates are key offerings that are indeed geared towards creative empowerment, but how easily does something like segmentation inspire boldness and creativity? In contrast, how many of these products and services are concerned with helping businesses reach people in better ways? (*Hint: literally, all of them are about that.*)

At present, the primary marketing message (and as a result, the look and feel of the rebrand) seem somewhat out-of-touch with what Mailchimp actually *does* (or rather, what it has done historically). With email marketing having been the company‚Äôs bread and butter and the central touchpoint for its customers since its inception, it‚Äôs not hard to imagine some other directions the rebrand could have gone in.

The concept of mail and traditional postage‚Äôs historical role in cementing human connections are ripe with readymade marketing metaphors for how a business can improve communications with its customers. Plenty of the playful design language that the agencies ultimately landed on can be housed under marketing messages more concerned with what the company actually offers: business solutions for reaching people.

When it comes to examples of brands that have navigated this divide adeptly, I think back to the popular G Suite advertisement which imagines Hall & Oates collaborating on the lyrics to *Maneater* in Google Docs. The message resonated well with customers because it included the spirit of originality and playfulness that Mailchimp is clearly after with this rebrand. However, it did so without deviating from the central value prop of the product: collaborative word processing.

## More Than Email

At this point, it‚Äôs pretty clear that Mailchimp is seeking to define itself beyond the confines of the email marketing niche (they even said so). It also seems somewhat ironic that they chose to focus on inspiring and enabling creativity when that focus is disconnected from the parts of the business which practically extend beyond email: connection, automation, and optimization.

David Martinez also made a solid point about the rebrand appearing to understate the company‚Äôs success in the email marketing niche. Mailchimp‚Äôs new approach doesn‚Äôt seem very reflective of the actual impact and scale of one of (if not) the largest email marketing platforms on the web experiencing daily growth on the order of 14K+ customers. The rebrand may be just as incongruent with what users want and expect out of the company‚Äôs products.

Is it fair to ask why Mailchimp feels the need to aggressively outgrow its roots? Is the company failing to embrace its own stated brand value of staying true to itself? It‚Äôs great that Mailchimp wants to inspire originality in brands that adopt it for marketing, but what if that‚Äôs not the value prop that customers are connecting with?

## Looking Forward

Pressing questions aside, I‚Äôm inclined to give Mailchimp the benefit of the doubt overall. Aiming to inspire originality and creativity instead of simply helping businesses reach people with better marketing services is an ambitious endeavor to say the least, and I respect that. It‚Äôs a bold decision to eschew the more banal SaaS marketing and branding tropes in favor of a mission that means something important to Mailchimp‚Äôs team and their story. The caveat is that I‚Äôm not sure whether or not a new brand identity and design system alone are enough to inspire users in that fashion.

<blockquote class="bigquote">
If Mailchimp truly desires to be more than mail and empower creativity, its product offerings may need to evolve in tandem with its new brand philosophy.
</blockquote>

Design templates are a start, but will Mailchimp introduce any new offerings to truly assist brands in finding and crafting their bold, courageous, creative, and authentic voices? Only time will tell, but I‚Äôm excited to see what unfolds since the company has teased more to come. It‚Äôs clear that Mailchimp has embraced the decisions underlying its new brand identity as a living set of principles intended to evolve with the business instead of edicts set in stone and that‚Äôs a very good thing.

Congrats to all teams involved with the new rollout!
