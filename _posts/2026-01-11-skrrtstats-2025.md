Another year, another deep dive into my [Yung Skrrt](https://twitch.tv/yungskrrt) listening data. This marks year five of tracking my consumption of the Gimbus GOAT's catalog, and 2025 was a big one.

## Retrospective: 5 Years of Gimbus

With five years of data now in the books, here's how 2025 stacks up:

| Year | Hours | Days | Unique Songs |
|------|-------|------|--------------|
| 2021 | 55.54 | 2.31 | 142 |
| 2022 | 96.50 | 4.02 | 223 |
| 2023 | 67.56 | 2.82 | 223 |
| 2024 | 51.59 | 2.15 | 261 |
| **2025** | **82.41** | **3.43** | **288** |

**Lifetime total: 353.6 hours (14.7 days) of Yung Skrrt**

### The Numbers

2025 was the second-highest listening year, trailing only the peak of 2022. But what stands out is the variety: 288 unique tracks is the most diverse year yet, suggesting I'm finally catching up with the ever-expanding Skrrt discography.

### Top Track Evolution

| Year | #1 Track | Plays |
|------|----------|-------|
| 2021 | *Ascendant Mode (Speedforce)* | 155 |
| 2022 | *Guardian Protector* | 103 |
| 2023 | *Arbitrary (No Service)* | 124 |
| 2024 | *jumpSkateSlide* | 105 |
| 2025 | *World Speed* | 50 |

The top play count dropping from 155 to 50 over five years tells a story: less obsessive looping, more even distribution across the catalog. *World Speed* earned its crown through consistent rotation rather than manic repetition.

### Perennial Favorites

Some tracks just keep showing up year after year:

- ***Scissors Cut It*** - the only track to appear in the top 22 all five years
- ***Never Nemesis*** - 2021, 2022, 2024
- ***Ascendant Mode (Speedforce)*** - went from #1 in 2021 to still charting in 2024
- ***Arbitrary (No Service)*** - #1 in 2023, still top 10 in 2025

### 2025 Highlights

This year saw heavy rotation of Skrrt's two ambient double-albums, which bookend the tracking years: *1+2(Ambient)* (2021) and *3+4(Ambient)* (2025). It seems that Yung Skrrt can offer a warm fleece during trying times just as well as a jumper cable shock when life calls for motion. New favorites like *Pop Like 3*, *Icarus Prophecy*, and *mirrorFaced* broke into the rotation alongside returning champions *World Speed* and *In The Back*.
