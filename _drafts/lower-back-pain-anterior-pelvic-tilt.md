have talked to a number of people who have some version of this from pelvic tilt. usually caused from sititng a lot, insufficient glute activation. etc.

passive stuff: find a work setup that lets the psoas muscle open up a little more; standing desk, kneeling stool, etc.—don’t wanna be crunched up 90º all day.

active stuff (ordered low to high intensity):
- retrain posture to support a neutral spine without rounding. practice pelvic tilts, make a habit of noticing and correcting forward tilt by engaging glutes.
- some core engagement can help: the drawing-in maneuver in tandem with pelvic tilts helps emphasize the corrective movement. can do core strengthening stuff and oher stretches on top to reduce back arching: planks, bird-dog, dead bug, cat-dow, child pose. couch stretch and pigeon pose will really help loosen psoas and hip flexors and improve hip mobility.
- strengthen glutes considerably and habituate self to more regular glute activation as part of posture so the back isn’t overused. glute bridges, hip thrusts, clamshells.

last bit is probably do things that engage the lower back and strengthen it, but with corrected movement mechanics. squats and squat holds can be good. hinging especially good: deadlifts, RDLs, kettlebell hinges with resistance or just repeating dynamic fwd folds without weight.
