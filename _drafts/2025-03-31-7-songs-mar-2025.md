### _Tears in Heaven_‚ÄîEric Clapton

I can never quite predict the lessons I'll come away from grief with. What seems true over time is that those lessons become easier to learn and that I grow in my ability to accept and process them more readily (even if some fighting and difficulty are involved). For the last few months, loss is something that has been more salient than I'd ideally like it to be, but I'm emerging from it as a stronger person with a more reassured and independent sense of self. I'm grateful for the transformation brought about by having known someone who is now gone; someone that has always been there for as long as I can remember and will now continue to be there, albeit in a different way.

*Tears in Heaven* is a tune with grief at its core: Clapton's tragic memorial of his son gone too soon after tumbling through a window at the tender age of four, enshrined enduringly in song. The forlorn longing in his voice is palpable when he pleadingly asks if his deceased boy would know his name should they meet in heaven. I'm not sure that matters to me now‚ÄîI have known and will remember her name in this life and I am much better for it.

<h3 class="mt-200"><em>Self/Less</em>‚ÄîAlecia Creti</h3>

I featured a track from Gallant in [last month's 7 Songs](/blog/2025/02/19/7-songs-feb-2025) and mentioned I'd had a chance to watch him perform live for the first time in a while at the Independent in San Francisco. Alecia Creti opened for him at that show and it was wonderful to get acquainted with her music alongside her detailed narratives about each number on her setlist. Her vocal performance was astounding and her simultaneous piano accompaniment intimate and moving.

Despite occasionally surfacing twinges of emotional immaturity, her interstitial monologues painted an authentic and endearing portrait of a young artist in the midst of experiencing their dreams come to fruition and developing a stronger sense of self that manifests powerfully in their craft. *Self/Less* is a track about having the courage and strength to put oneself first when doing so seems to run counter to duty to others (namely family). That theme resonated with me powerfully as I stood in the audience while Alecia belted the words.
