## Mission: Open + Decentralized AGI

Prime Intellect’s mission aligns with my evolving focus on designing for foundational impact over surface-level appeal. I’ve contributed across industries like consumer electronics, automobiles, education, health, energy, decentralized finance, and more, balancing technical and cultural design challenges. AI’s rapid integration into infrastructure and human experience makes it one of the most critical fields to shape today. My multidisciplinary and cross-functional background in designing brands, products, media, and experiences equips me to translate Prime Intellect’s vision into a compelling and coherent cultural presence. I’m excited to shape not just the company’s aesthetic but the broader semantic landscape of decentralized intelligence.

## Role Impact

> _As Generalist Designer, you will craft Prime Intellect’s visual and interactive presence across every touchpoint—UI, branding, motion, merch, and beyond. This role fuses design with systems thinking, requiring a sharp aesthetic, technical fluency, and an instinct for the cutting edge._

I am a generalist designer with over 15 years of experience integrating the above fluencies with broader technical and multimedia skills. I don't view design as a job title or visual practice; to me design is a utility belt full of tools and lenses that enable unique approaches to selecting and flexibly solving a wide variety of problems in the world. This rationale drives my desire to execute broadly while being able to dive deep in the contexts that call for it. Beyond producing artifacts that make visions real out of whole cloth, my ability to extend design thinking into the strategic realm has made me a Swiss Army knife trusted by founders and leaders as an invaluable thought partner.

## Core Responsibilities

### Brand & Visual Identity

> -   _Define and evolve a visual language that embodies decentralized intelligence_
> -   _Create high-impact graphics, presentations, and marketing assets_
> -   _Design merch and event collateral that extends our brand into the physical world_

I've designed identities and brand collateral across many contexts: defining look and feel for popular avant garde fashion brands (AWGE, Seventh Heaven, Helder Vices), introducing the invention of flash lending to decentralized finance with Marble Protocol, rebranding Deepak Chopra's digital meditation platform for 1.5 million users, and more. Creators and innovators have trusted me time and again to put them on the map with an aesthetic that speaks to their unique context. My advantage when designing for brands comes from keenly immersing myself at the leading edge of culture and tech, experimenting early on in new territory, and remaining style-agnostic enough to execute powerfully toward any vision.

### Web & UI/UX

> -   _Design intuitive, high-fidelity interfaces for AI researchers and developers_
> -   _Work with engineers to build fluid, performant user experiences_
> -   _Maintain and refine a scalable design system_

I’ve been designing for the web for over 15 years, starting with my own consultancy and evolving into an accomplished product designer and design engineer. My love for the web has made this my deepest skillset and driven my fascination with crafting compelling digital experiences. At Amazon, I led design systems and front-end development while embedded with engineering partners, contributing production code to unify third-party deployments on Alexa. My ability to work closely with engineers while thinking about interaction design at scale gives me a strong edge in building effective systems and well-considered interfaces.

### Multimedia & Motion

> -   _Produce sharp motion graphics and videos for product showcases and community engagement_
> -   _Optimize video content for maximum impact across platforms_
> -   _Experiment with 3D, generative art, and interactive storytelling_

My background in digital arts has given me a broad foundation in production methods, from 3D printing and audio engineering to projection mapping and live experience design. While most of my motion work has focused on interaction design, I’ve also produced multimedia content for brands, social marketing, and events. My early work in edtech launching a learning platform for creative technology skills also introduced me to generative art before modern transformer-based AI models, giving me exposure to the artful applications of Python, TensorFlow, and various neural network architectures. I've always relished opportunities to extend graphic media into time and space, whether to create strong impressions through video or to shape live experiences and immersive spaces.

## What We’re Looking For

### Core Skills & Experience

> -   [x] _Strong portfolio blending graphic design, UI/UX, and motion_
> -   [x] _Proficiency in Figma, Adobe Creative Suite, and motion tools (After Effects, Blender)_
> -   [x] _Experience designing for complex, technical interfaces_
> -   [x] _Fundamental understanding of front-end principles (HTML, CSS, JS a plus)_
> -   [x] _Ability to execute fast, iterate faster_

I hold a Graphic Design BFA from California Institute of the Arts and have received two awards from AIGA for excellence in the field. My print work has been featured in numerous Los Angeles exhibitions. I've worked on technical interfaces like admin dashboards for school information systems and was among the first crop of designers to push a more considered visual approach to smart contract analytics. I've been a web developer since day one, written production Typescript for Amazon Alexa's third-party app deployments, and taught web development at the undergrad level. The website you're reading right now is built the old-fashioned way without AI code generation (HTML, CSS, JS, Ruby, Jekyll). I've even hacked Figma with JavaScript injection to output a faithful Echo Show Alexa prototype complete with real-time voice detection.

### Nice to Have

> -   [x] _Experience with AI/ML-driven interfaces and technical visualization_
> -   [x] _Knowledge of Webflow, Framer, or similar prototyping tools_
> -   [x] _Open-source design contributions_
> -   [x] _Interest in the intersection of design, intelligence, and autonomy_

Most of my experience with AI/ML-driven interfaces comes from my time at Amazon Alexa leading customer experience design for emerging voice and multimodal technologies. I'm eager to bring that expertise back into my wheelhouse where more traditional interface surfaces can meet novel user experience patterns and paradigms. I've contributed generously to the design community (mentorship, writing and research, learning resources, design and code primitives), largely through growing the Designers Guild community into a global network supporting over 20,000 creatives across 100 countries. My [interest in Prime Intellect's mission](#mission-open--decentralized-agi) is bolstered by the emphasis on autonomy enabled by distribution; I'm a values-driven individual and that speaks to me in particular.

## Curated Works

*Note: work shown reflects past projects designed for specific visions, not a fixed personal style. My role as a generalist is to adapt to different aesthetics and objectives, not impose my own. Strong design fundamentals enable me to execute a wide range of styles with precision and experience tells me I'll meld with yours seamlessly.*
