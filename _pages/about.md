Stedman Halliday is a cross-functional product and design leader based in San Francisco. With over 15 years of experience across startups, creative agencies, and large tech orgs, he brings a versatile skill set that spans design, software, and strategy to shaping products, brands, and teams.

Stedman's recent work focuses on health, wellness, and connection. At Eat Blueprint, a longevity-focused meal service later acquired by Blueprint Bryan Johnson, he helped the company scale to $1M ARR through product development, customer experience, marketing, and events, programming community activations for over 1,000 Bay Area locals in Q1 2024.

Earlier, Stedman led UX and design systems work on emerging voice and multimodal tech at Amazon Alexa, shipping features for the Alexa TV app and collaborating closely with engineering teams. He’s since consulted with early-stage AI companies, helping shape consumer and enterprise tools and agent-based interaction patterns. At Wunderman Thompson, he led pandemic-era redesigns for key Microsoft platforms, including a 127% traffic lift for Microsoft Education.

Stedman’s roots are in education and creative technology. He helped launch Kadenze early in his career to scale arts and creative tech education. He later authored curricula and designed tactile learning tools for a government-funded initiative at Mahidol University that became Thailand's first computer programming course for blind adults. He held a special faculty position at CalArts, where he previously earned a BFA in Graphic Design with a minor in Digital Arts and was twice awarded the AIGA–Tomoko Miho Award for design excellence. Stedman's passion for learning branched out into community building when he helped grow Designers Guild into a global network supporting over 20,000 creatives across 100 countries.

A systems thinker with hands-on technical fluency, Stedman thrives where strategy meets execution. He’s especially energized by multi-disciplinary collaborative environments and projects that move culture and improve lives.
