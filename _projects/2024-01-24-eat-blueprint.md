Eat Blueprint was a Bay Area fresh meal delivery service for longevity optimization. After shutting down Athens Research (YC W21), founder Jeff Tang launched the service in the fall of 2023 with a Stripe link, an unholy volume of beets carted into a mutual friend's kitchen, and a rental van for DIY deliveries. I came on as Jeff's right hand soon after to grow the service (which thankfully included a move to a commissary kitchen and dedicated delivery logistics). Bryan Johnson acquired Eat Blueprint before launching the [Blueprint fresh meal service](https://meals.bryanjohnson.com) in Q3 2024.

During my time at Eat Blueprint, I developed menu products to align nutrition principles, food quality, and customer preferences, programmed longevity meetups attended by over 1,000 Bay Area locals and Bryan Johnson himself, produced marketing artifacts (web, video, merch, print) to drive over 585K organic impressions in Q1 2024, and operated a subscription platform to maintain a $1M annual recurring revenue run rate. Most importantly, we had a blast, started a powerful local movement, and shifted the needle on what it means for ambitious people to put their health first.
