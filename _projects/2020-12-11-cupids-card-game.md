Cupid's Cards was a playful experiment in human connection during a moment of global disconnection. Designed for the early days of the COVID pandemic, the app offered a deck of conversation prompts designed like Tarot cards for virtual first dates. Drawing on visual motifs from mysticism, romanticism, and the occult, it encouraged users to flirt, reflect, and be surprised. Each shuffle of the deck surfaced thoughtful, sometimes unexpected questions across five themed categories, with custom cards and interstitial surprises adding rhythmic breaks.

The experience wasn't just about utility; it was a gesture toward warmth, novelty, and a bit of magic in uncertain times. With randomly generated sigils and richly ornamental themes, Cupid's Cards brought a sense of ritual and delight to the act of getting to know someone over a screen.
