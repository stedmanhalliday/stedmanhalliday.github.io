I worked on brand identity, collateral, and art direction for the wedding of dear friends Brent and Lauren Javier in the fall of 2023. The theme was "technomagical tree grove," inspired by the landscape of the wedding venue in Chatsworth, California and Brent's vision of incorporating multimedia and projections to transform the setting into an enchanted forest. I first met with the groom the previous winter to discuss ideas and review an inspiration moodboard before writing a brief and collaborating with designer [Bradley Krebs](https://www.instagram.com/breadkrebs/) on the wedding logo and invitations.

The "Forever Butterfly" mark represents the couple's union under the venue's sacred tree, the stability and roots of a budding new family, and the greater heights their union will allow them to reach. The identity was carried across all collateral: invitations, signage, photography backdrops, napkins, menus, and more, in a variety of typographic treatments. The mark even made its way to LED displays on the dancefloor and DJ stage, enhancing the magical and immersive environment for the wedding guests.
