[Firmé Atelier](https://firme.studio/) is a Los Angeles-based bespoke fashion studio that crafts signature suits, couture collections, and bespoke pieces for renowned brands and talents like Lil Uzi Vert, J Balvin, and Karol G. I teamed up with visual director and co-founder, Paul Um, to launch Firmé Atelier on the web during its early days. I built the Firmé site with Jekyll and added a CMS (content management system) with Forestry.io to reduce upate and maintenance friction for the studio's team. The initial website incorporated brand assets, designs, and garment photographs provided by the studio alongside unique video reels from motion designer, [Guy Glikshtein.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoOrpz46oBs2HJpLx7L1x6Q)

I also built and deployed a custom Shopify theme for studio client [SEVENTH HEAVEN](https://seventhheaven.online/) as they launched their first full-range collection for the SS19 season (special thanks to Samuel Cormier for Shopify development tips). SEVENTH HEAVEN is a fashion label led by designer John Ross, known for his work with Playboi Carti, A$AP Bari and VLONE, Matthew Williams, and more.
