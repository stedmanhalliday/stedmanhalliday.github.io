Birdtag is a browser extension that lets users add persistent custom labels next to display names on X (Twitter), helping them keep track of people in a way that makes sense to them.

{% include soft-break.html %}

The extension lets users easily annotate usernames with nicknames, fun badges, notes about others' posts, reminders about where they met mutuals, or other useful context. Labels appear right above display names across the site, making it effortless to recall important details at a glance while scrolling the feed.

The extension is available for Chrome and Firefox. I designed and built it for myself as personal software and later published it to the [Chrome Web Store.](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/birdtag/ibpikkmaiihccfofhefekeomkplfgfpm)
