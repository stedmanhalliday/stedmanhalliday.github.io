I worked with the team at Wunderman Thompson to refresh Acura's vehicle features web experience. The primary goal of the
redesign was to create a compelling narrative with a mobile-first design that could increase clarity and navigational
ease as well as boost target engagement metrics.

## Problem

**How can a redesigned features experience improve navigation, balance simplicity and richness in information
presentation, clearly differentiate vehicle packages, and highlight signature Acura features?**

Various J.D. Power studies and customer experience interviews that shaped the brief revealed that model information
about vehicle features ranks among customers' most important reasons for visiting auto OEM websites and that this holds
especially true for Acura shoppers. Multimedia like images, video, and interactive 360º visualizations conferred an
advantage from the customer point of view, while pain points included navigational difficulties, information
comprehensiveness, and feature differentiation—both between Acura and competitors and within the different trims offered
for a vehicle.

## Inspiration & Exploration

We began explorations for this redesign with a competitive analysis of how other auto OEMs addressed our key pain points like navigation and by reassessing taxonomy as well as seeking out-of-category inspiration. We knew up front that multimedia and interactivity were positively received from Acura's previous performances in J.D. Power's Manufacturer Website Evaluation Studies, so we also brainstormed and sketched rough concepts that could emphasize those strengths and possibly incorporate components from adjacent experiences like model year overviews.

## Data & Analytics

While the design team embraced a far-and-wide approach to generative exploration, our data and analytics team worked in parallel to conduct deeper initial market research, evaluate the performance of the current experience, discover search trends, and poll feature popularity for different vehicle models.
