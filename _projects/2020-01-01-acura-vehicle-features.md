I worked with the team at Wunderman Thompson to refresh Acura's vehicle features web experience. The primary goal of the
redesign was to create a compelling narrative with a mobile-first design that could increase clarity and navigational
ease as well as boost target engagement metrics.

## Problem

**How can a redesigned features experience improve navigation, balance simplicity and richness in information
presentation, clearly differentiate vehicle packages, and highlight signature Acura features?**

Various J.D. Power studies and customer experience interviews that shaped the brief revealed that model information
about vehicle features ranks among customers' most important reasons for visiting auto OEM websites and that this holds
especially true for Acura shoppers. Multimedia like images, video, and interactive 360º visualizations conferred an
advantage from the customer point of view, while pain points included navigational difficulties, information
comprehensiveness, and feature differentiation—both between Acura and competitors and within the different trims offered
for a vehicle.

## Inspiration & Exploration

We began explorations for this redesign with a competitive analysis of how other auto OEMs addressed our key pain points like navigation and by reassessing taxonomy as well as seeking out-of-category inspiration. We knew up front that multimedia and interactivity were positively received from Acura's previous performances in J.D. Power's Manufacturer Website Evaluation Studies, so we also brainstormed and sketched rough concepts that could emphasize those strengths and possibly incorporate components from adjacent experiences like model year overviews.

## Data & Analytics

While the design team embraced a far-and-wide approach to generative exploration, our data and analytics team worked in parallel to conduct deeper initial market research, evaluate the performance of the current experience, discover search trends, and poll feature popularity for different vehicle models.

Data & Analytics

Data and analytics findings for feature popularity, search interest, and engagement

Some decisions that can be made with data are rather low-hanging fruit: keyword research and engagement metrics helped us decide what language speaks most effectively to customers or reprioritize certain modules in a straightforward manner. Design can really shine most where it meets the challenge of using quantitative findings contextually in tandem with human-centered thinking to shape a compelling narrative that truly captures customer interest. Examining data with a wider perspective encouraged us to add audio, connectivity, and safety to the list of categories that emerged from our exploration phase's sorting exercises and focus on how exactly we wanted to communicate their value to customers. Focusing on the human element allowed us to recognize that most people's last car purchase was also the most expensive integrated computer purchase of their lifetime and that vehicle audio is most people's peak listening experience. There was an opportunity to provide reassurance here with features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integrations but also introduce surprise with new technological capability like Amazon Key in-car delivery.

Despite its lesser popularity as an explicitly categorized feature, we recognized a focus on interior and comfort as a narrative gateway to those experiences since it constitutes the ambiance in which they take place. For SUVs, we could focus on utility by demonstrating interior configurability and for sedans, we could steer toward our brand differentiation goals. We could lean into sedan shoppers' elevated interest in performance here with the understanding that it's not just a measurement—it's an aesthetic and the primary brand pillar for Acura. There was an opportunity to showcase additional package features like ambient lighting or highlights and detailing that complement and enhance the vehicle and its experiences in ways unique to Acura and its design sensibilities to make the car look and feel like a performance vehicle.

## Wireframes, Specs, and Prototypes

Granular data on which features proved popular in which contexts provided helpful directionality when it came time for the design team to prune concepts and align on more focused treatments that could address customer interests and resonate with what people want most in a new vehicle. I authored the initial functional specification document by outlining the appearance and behavior of various components in mobile and desktop viewports and creating structural narratives that explored how different modules could work to support customer understanding of each feature category.
