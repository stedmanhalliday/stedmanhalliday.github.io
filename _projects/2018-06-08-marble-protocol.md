In recent years, the blockchain boom has provided countless opportunities for innovation and competition in financial technology applications. Marble entered the fray by introducing the novel arbitrage concept of flash lending and enabling a more frictionless market for cryptocurrency derivatives. After receiving sponsor prizes from Dharma and MakerDAO with a submission to the ETHDenver hackathon as well as a grant from The Stable Fund, Marble sought additional investment to further develop and deploy smart contracts and core technologies.

An attentively designed brand identity could legitimize Marble's vision, attract investor interest, and propel the company towards its goals in the crypto space.

At launch, Marble received 4,000 mailing list signups and galvanized a community that was excited about its innovations and protocol. The brand also succeeded in its primary goal of attracting investor interest, raising $400K with a pre-seed SAFE at a valuation cap of $3.5M.
